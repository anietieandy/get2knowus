Twas dad. I chopped the video up a bit to keep it short and stuck bits of audio on top of each other, so you're hearing my voice from one bit and my beats from another. Lucky we stayed in the groove! 
I was feeling guilty about making a video my kid will be mortified about when he's a teenager. Now it turns out it's a PSA about electrocuting babies.

They aren't mutually exclusive.
Exactly this. Ask her whether she's OK with you dating while she dates.And I guarantee you this isn't a hypothetical. She has someone in mind; I'd put money on it.
Saw them do that here in Portland this last September. It was one of the happiest experiences of my life, *especially* because I didn't know that was the plan until 3 songs in.
I'm only counting in-park beers of course, pre-gaming is a different matter all together. &gt;Who can pay for parking No parking, son. The subway is like two bucks each way.
They literally look like pennies.
I like that he threw 6TDs in consecutive games. I don't know how many people are aware of that. He was a monster.
That's probably a step up from the toilet paper they supply is with at my work.
All of their advise aside, it's just a fun read.
It does, you would need to remove it before going online. Anything that injects code is a no go
Milk is mostly water, so yes, they would lose their power.    They'd probably be ok in more viscous stuff like maple syrup, though.
count me in on that.  status update meetings in my experience   have only one consistent outcome: taking a bite out of productivity. If it could have been accomplished with an email, then we've just wasted time that no one will get back.
To be fair I'm from the east coast of the US and tornadoes would probably make its way into the first five minutes of our conversation.
Chairborne Rangers!(Btw: I heard that phrase from my step-dad, who was an actual Airborne Ranger.)
The Duggars are also very wealthy. This could be good for a sizeable campaign donation.
Thank you to the hundreds of posters in this thread for sharing your opinion on Anna Kendrick's appearance.

Yes. Other schools had weighted GPA, but ours didn't.
It's amazing. Last week I posted a musical fart that got 2 million views, and the comments were overwhelmingly positive.
How about high crime area...and predom - oh wait, nevermind.

No you are just limiting it to something your GPU can actually handle. I haven't noticed any changes to anything other than Hairworks hair.

So your way of dealing with your anxiety and self esteem issues is to censor things like photos of you?Sounds more like not dealing with the issues.

Sorry. I read it as cheap and meant to type cheap tactic, but put cheat in there instead. I had just replied to a post about cheating and must have still had it on my kind. 
Fuck yeah, Malek. You schooled Dax. 
It's not a good solution to the problem at hand.   Creating heat is actually one of the. Out energy efficient things we know how to do.  When heat is the primary product 
Please, that would involve thinking about others. 
Holy crap, get those PSA graded promptly.

*internet high five*I go back to using gopher on my 2400 baud via my mom's uni dialup account (circa 92, I think?)It's been quite a ride. I am grateful to have been born at the right time to get the perspective I did. 
Okay, fair enough....for your circumstances but for somebody just going to Univeristy, I'm going to need a little bit more convincing.
Pick something (a specific shelf in the pantry, a light bulb in a spot that makes the MOST sense) and break it or empty the shelf.  About half the time.  HA!

Do you want to build a snowman?
Then what do you suggest? Am I supposed to throw my shit plastered wet wipe in the garbage? Do you want to take the garbage out several times a say, because I don't.
For now. Until FEMA gets involved. 
(sigh).... if 70% of the movie is done via CGI.. then the cost and trouble of shooting IMAX seems a bit unnecessary since CGI is independent of the quality of filming. Also thought that pic was just funny. :)
What about a central authority that doesn't violate your bodily autonomy?

If you have no clue that's not great. Either way, tell her the truth and see how things go. 
You could buy a decent house with cash and have the rest put away for your yearly taxes/utilities. You'd pretty much only need to work for food/pleasure money. 
How does that work? Are they processing more instructions per cycle or something? 
I agree.  I'm up by at 7 at the latest on the weekend.

Considering the average cost of people's collections here are around 10 grand, it's not *that* crazy. Plenty of people have significantly more valuable collections.But I agree, having that kind of money is unfathomable.

Time to stream Alien and Aliens.  I think you can skip Alien 3 unless you really want more.  Alien Resurrection was horrible.
Beautiful, wonderful idea. A 1000 times yes.

Me too. I've always thought that should be the case. 
The hardest part is the measuring (and it's not that hard). Once you get everything measured and cut, it's maybe 40 seconds of sewing and 90 seconds of pressing.

I have heard most guys like it if you do a play by play of what's happening in an old timey sports announcer voice. J/K, you should really be asking him for these examples. 
Wights are any human corpse reanimated by the White Walkers.  The White Walkers are a separate, magical race that live in The Lands of Always Winter.
Nothing. Mythbusters busted the myth of anything bad happening. Check out the episode, they even have adam savage hold his eyes open while sneezing is glorious slow motion.
No class can prepare you for babies.You'll be faced with all kinds of decisions all the time.Just do what you think is best. Be on the same page as the mom. Let them experiment, get hurt, and play.You'll do a good job.

Technically glass-steagall was repealed under Clinton, which most experts see as precipitating the crisis
This is interesting to me. I've fixed them, loaded rockets and missiles and now I fly them, but I've never loaded the gun. I'll see if I can find out what that last/first round is all about
I just re-read the title.  I'm American, I totally skipped over the "Non-americans or Reddit" part.  Sorry.
There is literally a KFC across the street from the Sphynx, I swear to god.

Serious question: why do people respect fire fighters so much but detest cops?  Edit: I can take my downvotes like a man, do your worst
Well, I'm 34 and I just want to say... if you're a twenty-something that hasn't had sex in the last year, but want to... call me.
Meanwhile, they infected everything around them, like your kitchen counter that you had all your other food resting on.
Yup. I've been the other guy a few times, and generally it's a very pleasant situation to be in. Not exactly moral high ground though, I'd be forced to admit.
It was actually the Meat Puppets that guested at Unplugged. The Vaselines did join Nirvana on stage once (Eugene did) at the Reading Festival
Mate they've been playing on the BBC in the UK. It's everywhere. 
If you want to take them home with you afterward then it's a deal!         Did we just go from a date to you babysitting my kids? 
He's not really wrong. Youth is pretty universally a feature of attractiveness. 
Program will have run out of money and been cancelled by then.
Who's going to pay to take it to court?
Blatter has to be shitting himself.
all I could think is, kidnapping and torture is something Mexicans deal with on a daily basis in a way most Americans can't understand. So I wonder how much of that is desensitization to their society's out-of-whack norms.
This pisses me off so much I don't even know what to say.
As the BBC puts it he is either complicit or incompetent.
I totally sing that one in the band... Maybe that's where my date got it from!
Pizza. easy win. Already eat it everyday
Shippers work for free?  I didn't know that!  Good to know.  Next time I talk to the UPS guy, I'll ask how he makes ends meet.  &lt;sarcasm&gt;
TL;DR: he didn't ride eternal, shiny or chrome. Valhalla ended up being pretty lonely for a guy with 5 wives. 
Lifted a motorcycle with one hand.  Adrenaline and shock after an accident is crazy.
I didn't.  I just left it.  It was in the woods, with my napkin toilet paper.
Fucking non stop emails go right to spam
Oh, he knows. He should be punished with a high five.
I feel like you probably knew about /r/good_cop_free_donut and got the rest by looking at "related subreddits" on the sidebars of some obvious ones.Yes, I'm overly cynical.
I am the very model of a scientist Salarian.
Politicians and the corrupt do. 
I was confused by it. It was easier to see the plot holes with an explanation. I couldn't see the others it was like a bunch of random movie pictures
Yes I have held a newborn and I can tell you that it is not the second as pregnancy at all. For example, the baby is literally not inside the woman's body. That makes a huge difference when you are discussing the issue of women's bodies.
Yes, I bought it, I was already in the workforce and had lots of disposable income relative to my peers.  I wasn't rich, I simply didn't save any money.  ;)
When you have those moments, just tell yourself STOP. Say it out loud if you have to. You've been abused for a long time. It's going to have lasting effects.

Well, reading the sidebar *is* impossible for people on (many) mobile platforms.

I know this feel, bro.Wanna share some Werther's candy and yell at these damn kids on my lawn?
Is he volunteering to go shopping?
No, they just have different views about what it means and what each relationship should look like. To say they don't understand marriage because they don't share your views on it is ridiculous.
Even if that is true, it's not a very good defense.
click the gear in the bottom left area of the galaxy client. It should say where it is installing (if you haven't specified otherwise it defaults to your main drive/gog games)
I don't think she asked for the open relationship. I think she asked her husband for a physical relationship over and over and he said open relationship as a solution. She doesn't really seem that interested in fucking other people.
Yeah, I'll show you my "passport"! \*reaches down front of pants, producing an actual passport\* ... what?

Richmond, VA is the same way.  They also have abandoned streetcar rails in the roads.
I'm sorry, I'm totally lost on the motivation part of this.

Why? Losing your virginity is really not a big deal, at all.
Dont get me wrong, I dont believe in god as much as the next guy, but in a world absent religion, this dude would have found a reason to kill everyone.  People with mental illnesses find a way to be crazy.
