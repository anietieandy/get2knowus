Tucked in is *I'm a dad and don't care what I'm wearing as long as it covers my body*.I'm a powerlifter/bodybuilder, 5'10", loading season I'm 290 lbs or so, I slim down to 255-260 for the summer, the difference in skating is ridiculous!  I'm so much faster and more agile, I also break less sticks!10/10 body, 7/10 face. I guess I'm on Team Remove... it *does* give some character, but at the same time, not. You're gorgeous either way though.So what you're saying is you're not into stiffs, but strip with a stiffy. We'll call you StiffySprinkles. Nobody needs to know your "guvment name".Skips meal!  You mean starvation mode? That's how you GET fat, the body stores it up.(Is this right? I read it on the Internet)Really? I've been living in this body for years and not only have I never noticed that I look younger. No one has ever pointed that out.My son is only three months old, I totally don't have the dad forearms yet :(...And feminists want to talk about unrealistic expectations of body imageGood for her. With that body she can get any black man she wantsI'm a dad, and I have 10% body fat.  That's a proper dad bod that your wife and children will respect.  Tim and the team at Apple now are great but nobody comes close to Steve giving keynotes. The iPhone is the top point but every one is great, so natural. Yes I have held a newborn and I can tell you that it is not the second as pregnancy at all. For example, the baby is literally not inside the woman's body. That makes a huge difference when you are discussing the issue of women's bodies.As long as I draw breath, I will never let anybody forget how fucking good Los Campesinos! are. They are possibly my most favorite band, ever.[Thank you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxAKFlpdcfc). Somebody needed to say it.
