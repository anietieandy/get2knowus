Get a new 2016. The head unit revisement is a big upgrade for the interior of the car 
Android auto is probably a new thing that's why. They can update it in the future. Still though I find it to be impressive mainly because iPhone has no such functionality so the ability to even do a few things like such is cool to me.

Underlying issues aside, the next time you get up to do something and he says "Laying with me isn't something to do?", say "Going on a walk with me isn't something to do?" It's time you demonstrated to him that he is not the only person on the planet.

...and by the way, part of the reason it is the way it is with the Wii U is because of the hackers who basically turned the Wii into a cheap system with thousands upon thousands of "free" games.  Nintendo learned a hard lesson.

It always seemed that in the past when I've made critical statements about Apple that I assumed would be popular and most Apple fans could see as a problem ... have been down voted to oblivion.

I have several moles and my hair changes colors.
I went through a phase of doing that, right before the snapchat thing. Then I realized I needed a break. Since then I haven't done it as often- but coincidentally. Mainly life's just been intruding lately. 
That was not what i was expecting from reading the title.Anyways, sorry, losing pets sucks
Sounds nice! Lately i've really wanted to move to this town in England. Sounds stupid for an American to want to move there i know, but, gosh, this town is so pretty. From the pictures i want to move there and never come home.
So much ***giggity*** in your post and first line...
Oh thanks! I wasn't sure about /r/themall because I don't have an etsy shop (or interest in opening one). I'll post there too though, with your blessing. ;)I lub you guyz

The circus used to set up in my high school's parking lot every year.  Rumor has it that a clown knocked up a girl who went to school there.  Now the circus doesn't come around anymore.

I'm pretty sure being dead would be considered in the 'unable to consent' territory of rape.

What day/time/place I'd be interested in coming out as well 
The fact that you think they are soulless knockoffs made without love is just plain wrong. Many of the games are made by small teams who do it for the love of the project, with little hope of actually making money off the game. 
Wow, you just gave me something fun to do on the way to work.  No FI for me.

Chinese Wok Express serves it, and I seem to recall it's pretty good. Their fried rice is amazing.House of Chow does too. It's a great place if you haven't checked it out.
I love the attention given to individual peasants in the boondocks. The notice board is hilarious because of all the petty libel and help wanted notices.
I am curious about this too. Is this limited to certain systems?  Is there a way to protect yourself, or know if/when this is being done/attempted?

About $450k a year. I financed the 911. Costs me about $1300 a month after a fairly sizable downpayment, but this is in Norway, so car prices are a bit... exaggerated.

They did come up with a surprisingly effective vaccine, though.  The real numbers were better than what was published.  The weird thing is that, when given to healthy people, it increases your chances of contracting it.

The video clip is even better because it's got the audio of the two Russians in the POV car saying hilarious sounding Russian shit and laughing that throat-scraping Russian laugh. 
I could do without the Pall Malls....but damn now I want a brisket.
So she only writes on one side of the page.
Because junkie is so much better :)
He should have gotten a guy Brazilian 
Did you get white or colored by any chance?  edit: nvm. Looks like they only sell white.  I will give them a try too. Thanks.
Dam, I love finals! Your are beautiful and that is a fantastic bod!
Hello zebra! Can I get a ride? ;-)
I don't think we have enough information to really know where Battlefront is. At this point all of the outright hate is a little misguided.
You may be right, but consider that the screen size of the Transformer is 10.1 inches. Screen size or performance? You have to make sacrifices at this price point.
Or that first time they fall down / fall off the bed? PANIC. Everytime after that? "Meh. Made of rubber"
That time I gassed 6 million jews.
Fewer working days I think would work best for me.  That would give me whole days with my SO.  I would enjoy 3-4 workdays per week instead of 5.  Honestly, I've often thought that the "8-5 Monday-Friday" is random and stupid to enforce.
Went to high school with kid who played the young version of Sean Penn's character in Mystic River... Sean Penn was in Mystic River with Kevin Bacon. Boom.
Alison Brie.But also the like harcore hitting shit. No one needs that.
I remember:        Ich spiele fusball.        Spielen wir es tut mir leich? 
I eat my poached eggs with a fork.  Is that wrong? 
Relax, swim **across** it (ie parallel to the beach) to where the water is calmer, then swim back in once you are out of it. After my personal experience, I would also put in signalling an arm up for help somewhere in there too.
I'd forgotten about TV actually, and the massive licensing deals for the world cup.
I will be *completely* shocked if this doesn't happen.
Huh, so it ties shifting to the ECU?  Did not know that.

I've actually been to Red Rooster, and live in East Harlem. Eddie's depiction of what he thinks Harlem is is way out-dated, with an almost exoticizing nostalgia.
What's that got nothing to do with how a woman binds with her baby.
I'm a dad.  When I want something (and there's money), I buy it.  This spring I bought myself a motorcycle.  I don't really even want to give my money to my wife and kid so they can buy me something I might not even want.
Also for us maritimers it's old news we've been watching since the beginning whereas the current level of fame is because of Netflix picking it up, I remember several years ago bbc America picked it up and it didn't go over all that well. 
The comment was deleted, but I just peeked through that guy's comment history and he is a *real* piece of work. Apparently he's a mod on a hilariously awful racist subreddit that I won't name. What did his comment here say? 
Bjork at Carnegie Hall. It was amazing
Hi Sera!Welcome to the sub! That /u/TheMasterCthulhu guy is pretty alright. 
Sure, but AJ does plenty of mocking himself, so I'm not too bothered by that, I guess.
I've heard of that ride before. Arrow had batwings on a lot of their rides, i guess that is pretty close to a cobra roll too
I know this would be a great joke for it ! So now we know cats, dogs, babies, and apparently drunk people like laser pointers 
That changes with the day but desserts are my jam. Pies soups. 
I find it hard to believe Wilt never did this though...
It's Plasti Dip. It's fucking shit.
&gt; Like I'd bet somehow in the future, the Jimbei cover story will be relevant.He found a poneglyph, then was shown with a poneglyph-sized cube as he was leaving. It will definitely be relevant.
Like making Gordon Freeman talk 
Oh god no. I learned my lesson back in the Roy Jones Jr. days
Why in God's name did I have to control-F for this?His look around Limitless and that Vegas movie defined American good looks for me. &lt;being non American&gt;
I NEED YOU LIKE WATER LIKE BREATH LIKE RAIN
Up?  I thought Houston was the pubes of Texas. How much farther south can you be? Unless you're in the taint - El Paso. 
Ach, zo'n enorme meningsfreedom fighter is die Geert niet hoor. [Hij vindt ook wel eens dat cartoons weggehaald moeten worden](http://www.elsevier.nl/Nederland/nieuws/2011/2/Wilders-Cartoon-moet-van-VARA-site-anders-geen-debat-ELSEVIER289185W/).
Yeah I hear you there. I'm on skype and facebook and fuckall whatever else too, and the offer stands. Even if it's just to bitch/moan/vent. 
A line item veto would be a Godsend to the American people. 
[This comes to mind](http://www.quick-break.net/c/2013/07/01/We_are_lesbians.gif)
I like "Event Horizon", excellent set direction and use of color.  
Cool. Times change. I still like Hoax 4 and VG 8 style stuff the best.
Yeah but the inside of your egg will be cooked and won't come into contact with your other food while sitting on your counter/in your fridge.
I just got off work, now I'm going through a huge pile of unread comments/messages here. :D
What? I thought everybody loved that record!
&gt;These industry representatives have secured billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies to produce and market the very foods that make us sick.That sentence has a lot of what is wrong with America crammed into relatively few characters.
If it's not carbonated, it's flat.  And you can't ride a bike with a flat!
sorry but i don't agree... you can't help who you fall in love with
Tracking growth is part of weight training.  It's not a vanity thing.

This website has a fucking menu button for Gamergate. What a bunch of dickbags.    And since when is a PS4 nearly $700?    EDIT: holy shit is this some Return Of Kings knockoff I wasn't aware of?
Well, I'm glad I haven't been on the internet long enough that I've become desensitized to things like that. That person is disgusting. He sounds like a fucking cartoon villain. How the hell do people like this exist?
The "perfect design" they are famous for died a few years ago with Steve Jobs. They have been making a lot of stang decisions lately that I don't think he would have signed off on. 
I'd just shrink my cat. She's pretty stuck up being all regular size. I bet being tiny will put her in her place.
Dont get me wrong, I dont believe in god as much as the next guy, but in a world absent religion, this dude would have found a reason to kill everyone.  People with mental illnesses find a way to be crazy.
I know, right? Jeb blew up a rocket and I got to watch him respawn in the kerbonaut training facility 
Not gonna happen.  Private property, what manager is gonna piss off a wealthy customer?
COOPER AND DARNELL TAKE ON DORNE 
Imagining you "defiantly seeing this work". The look on your imagined face is hilarious. Defiance, rage, inquisitiveness, and eureka all together. 
did you know that humor is subjective?
Jimmy Pesto Jr.: The Nice Guy Years

Sometimes people get the joke, but the joke just isn't funny.
This should be easy to solve; the UK has CCTV everywhere.
People actually move out of the way for emergency vehicles in other places? Here in Los Angeles, you'd probably just get yelled at or shot. 
DID WE SERIOUSLY PASS OVER GUIDED BY VOICES AGAIN    ARE YOU KIDDING ME GUYS    ARE. YOU. KIDDING. ME.
That show went so far out there how could expect anything else?
Me screaming: "Oh my god. It's eating me! Starting with the butt!"
I had a kid because accidents happen, but there's a lot of fun in now having the ability to show someone Star Wars, Ghostbusters, Jaws, Jurassic Park, and The Beatles.    And that's pretty dope.
But pissing on the graves of 1000 years worth of ancestors to hand your country over on a platter to muslims who have no problem beheading your soldiers in the street while everyone watches......*that's* truly civilized
If what you are is "a character played by god." How can you drop the act? 
looking so cute and sexy in those pigtails!!!!
Let's yoga together and I can help you stretch!
It corners and handles extremely well for a 4500+ lb station wagon. But yeah that's what I would drive if I was a dad lol. 
Oh my god what is that horrible space monster attacking the earth!Wait, its just a smudge on the window, nevermind
Only things I don't really like are that you cut off its feet and that his placement in the frame doesn't feel balanced. Otherwise, it's pretty nice... Good textures and I really like the almost chiaroscuro style lighting. 
Is there an /r/momboobs or something along those lines with just pictures of mature tatas? I found /r/realolderwomen, but I'm looking for something that just shows their ripened melons and not their aged beef curtains. 
It think /u/M0b1us0ne is right, there's one west of Springdale on 412, you can see the concrete tower from the hiway (I think)If you run out of options, Modern Mission is a BLAST.  It's laser tag, but it's still very fun.
I don't wear hats and I probably wouldn't take my hat off.
You need to send me the video for it to be a submission. Send me a PM for instructions.
You look great, but picture 4 is by far the best. Too much distraction going on in the others.
Restraint and foresight is for sun singers, not Gunslingers. Although I roll 'Trance nowadays as I think it gives more benefit overall, but I immediately noticed combustion not combusting and turned it back on when I tried out Gunfighter. 
I just posted a quasi-poll to gather some reddit date in order to create a poll for PvP weapons. I'd appreciate your I put and feedback. Thanks. 
FWIW, Dayton has a better last, don't beat yourself up *too* much.
Just because you like the song they play every time doesn't mean you care that it's their shtick.
750cc in line 4.  Claimed 74 hp when new, is still in decent shape.  Also adding blue dots up front to stop it.
Damn it bruh! There goes my left over pizza lunch.
I am a fan of "a relatively old woman whom gives this boy a blow-job (oral sex)"
You are so beautiful and sexy! I love that first one, dam, I love your look!Tank you for sharing! I think I'm in lust with you!
We could have done that before too. But we want it all for ourselves. Someone will.
Yeah, if you look day by day, it's busy for a month then nothing, then busy again....
I'm with you. I didn't think the ending was groundbreaking or surprising. I thought that the Lutece twins were far more interesting characters, and that their story was better. 
Not following her relentlessly until I stopped and spoke to her 19 years ago.Never be afraid, never stop chasing.
bowl. black beans. rice. fajita veg. pico. the fiery stuff. guac.i stuff it in my face one forkful at a time. that's about it.
I thought vitamin c at least had some semi compelling evidence of immune boosting properties.  Not a major effect but enough that it was statistically significant as long as you started immediately upon feeling ill. Did that turn out to be bull crap? 
Pretend that you were not the person who wrote this post and read it. Really read every word. Pretty fucked up, huh? What would you tell that person to do?
Indy will let Peyton go to pursue a rookie.
Wait... 33? I assumed you were a kid. How did it take you this long to discover the Dead? I'd love to hear this back story. Cheers. 
I was about to ask "she's rich, right?" But if she's doing 50 she's def not rich. 
Does he have any good qualities? Why are you with him beyond the fact that he has a pulse and a penis?
I have two older sisters and a younger,  adopted sister.   I get along great with all of them honestly.  My oldest sister and I get along best, but we are a close family that gets along and communicates well,  it's fun actually.  
TIL there's a market for commercial suborbital launches
Seriously? you can't think of a single way to handle a bad situation besides seriously injuring some girl? He could have told her to stop, for one.
Not especially - I'm in East Saint Paul.  I'm probably gonna ride down to LaCrosse next weekend, might be up to head Saint Cloud way some weekend after that.  TBH, I don't know the area very well, despite living here some time.
Oh yay! She better like it. &gt;:) She actually likes cats more than I do, so I'm sure we're good. ;) Thanks so much!
I'm an extra teeth person too. It's like... let's form the shitty X-Men team. Mutants with totally useless powers.

That's a reverse fupa wedgie, cotton - I haven't seen that in a looong time. That's rare. Neat. 
I went on a mediterranean cruise two years ago. saw rome, genoa, marseilles, palma, barcelona, valencia. miss it terribly. I've seen much of the united states too.
When i was a kid i thought after you got sunburned and our skin peeled off, the layer of skin below that was a different color. Like, you get sunburned, peels off, and you're black. Then you get sunburned, the next layer is white again.

Get rid of that 'up next' autoplay they now have. Drives me insane.
God helps those who help themselves. 
Heh. This is true. But he is still only 28.
To some. As it ages, the toe box develops small ripples if unstructured. 
They probably aren't in Maine. They could wander around forever just looking for someone to attack.
Onder telegraafjournalisten ook.
That sub produces a disproportionate amount of drama.
If you got a loss it's something different. They got a loss too. What OP described gives you a win and the other team nothing. 
Ohh you meant A beater car that "only" lasts 5-6 years is a decent car. Not&gt;A car that "only" lasts 5-6 years is a decent car. Makes sense I withdraw my weird face
It'd be misleading if there wasn't a beer can being used. I'd rank it less misleading than cheesecake, which contains no cake, or chicken fried steak, which ain't got shit to do with chicken.It's all about your own expectations. 
Honestly, Doom is still one of the most under developed characters in Marvel's arsenal. I would love to see a cross over with Doom and Luther.
What sort of trouble are you trying to prevent?
I'm a dad, and I have 10% body fat.  That's a proper dad bod that your wife and children will respect.  
The problem with statistics is they will make you stereotype a whole group of people.
Christ, I love it when this happens. Dude gets all defeny, people tear him to shreds over it. Perfect.    Bet the dude assumed it was a Black Eyed Peas song or something. Probably didn't know better than to fuck with Tribe.
Tim and the team at Apple now are great but nobody comes close to Steve giving keynotes. The iPhone is the top point but every one is great, so natural. 
As someone who grew up with cats...  that was not unexpected.  Cats go from chill to bath-salts in no time.
Good good. I'll return to pounding your momma from behind. 
Two days for a half hours worth of what dad shows you when you're 7?
I do the exact same thing. I love my frickin ergo. Allows me to play videogames while also being a responsible parent... AND I get a workout, because I'm pacing back and forth *while* playing
So you're saying...  there's a chance?
This is just terrible, like the worst response
I'm joking man but yeah lower  your car. And uh depending like if you got coilovers you could just throw the stock suspension back in if you needed warranty work 
Fake guitars go hand in hand with their fake problems
No, he's asking for a super flashy anime series to totally ruin the look and feel of the Witcher.
Oh low call volume is another issue
You mean the VAN Allen belts?Yeah um, James Van Allen himself said there's no issue going past them (There's 2 belts, btw)We went through them in 1964 with no issue. 
I was young.  What do you want?
Yup. Kermit just doesn't sound right now.
But he's Canadian so I'm letting that slide.
I agree, on the long term it can be a win-win, but short term if the problem is going to be solved the people who are trying to block storage sites have to lose.
Honest Services Fraud. Essentially defrauding anyone dealing with Fifa who lost business or service (e.g. the world cup bids) because they didn't bribe.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honest_services_fraud
I've actually seen that done before. It was worth every minute.
Sounds great, where do I sign up?
He asked if it should.  Not if it is.
ah, the old apple lock-in of death. I see.  I bet you've spent hundreds of iMusic too yes?Well, don't say I didn't warn you. Okay, I didn't warn you.
You will never be as happy as a dog

I got a real degree and never took psych, so nope
Oh whoops. Meant the other guy.
Nope I've been in 5 wedding parties so far and just nope
But most accidents happen because of *oh shit* things though, not just because of overuse of force. I think any injury that might last for a lifetime is fairly serious.
And looking great while doing it! Wishing I could have cocktails with you ;-)
You are so pretty, very sexy and beautiful!
Love your sexy attitude! so beautiful and hot! I would so take you on the floor right now! 
I like the blue/green combo. While your at it, change the green to black. That way you have a blue top for our aviation heritage then black for oil underneath. 
What is it with table top gaming and poly??  I mean it's adorable and I love all my table top gamers, but it seems like 80% of all poly people I've met are already in the middle of a game!
Insurance can be a great thing to have. Depending on what you're doing you may not need a permit. Here in Florida if the crew is less than 3 (I think) and you don't have a tripod you don't need a permit to film in public.
Ah, right. Makes sense. That's pretty much a full fun of sizes.
Gorgeous in a very *cute* way. 9/10 or so. Would attempt to convert.
Tucked in is *I'm a dad and don't care what I'm wearing as long as it covers my body*.
I don't think boss was using corporate money.  Just that he covered for OP with corporate, and separately paid the fee.
Nice. The Sturm Panzer crest would be easy to do.
201, my son's birthday, I'd say it was a pretty lucky day. 
The commercial Internet is 20 years old.  Late bloomer, I would have to say based on your observation.
I probably will. I had given up on Autechre previous to hearing this comp, it's like, there is Autechre that i will like. Like i said, Amber was alright, i'm just much more of an Aphex Twin man myself
Night blue will be the hardest to keep clean. Reflex silver should be easy. Carbon steel is pretty much in between it gets dirty quick but doesn't look dirty from  10 feet away. I can get away without washing my car for about 2 weeks. 
Aww &lt;3I do it too sometimes. I think it's natural to offer advice, but if you keep pushing and pushing and pushing that advice it's like okay guys. Stahp. 
=[ At least try to find an electrical closet.
I did UP with one failure at the point where you should fall anyways to speed it up
You are correct, but if I had continued on that path no one would be making a movement for me and I would die exactly where I belonged.
*I hold you close.* I love you, Adria. Magic or no, yer still Adria. That's all that's important, okay? 
It's too bad they never made another record after Tromp le Monde, I'd love to see how Pitchfork would treat a Pixies record that hasn't been out for 20 years.
It's a user generated content and news community filled with everything from the everyday to the deep subjects to the mundane to the extremely fringe and dirty.
I don't know that it's relevant to what I'm posting.

You can create statistics to prove anything, 14% of people know that.

I don't follow the Bundesliga that closely. Whatever happened to Dost? I remember he went on that tear a couple months back, but haven't heard anything since. He still playing well, or did he just have a spurt of good form?
Is his front tire on backwards?
What? No! That's not OK at all. Call the police!
...said Ripley to the android Bishop.
You're right. There's absolutely no evidence to suggest that PB is anything more than bisexual. There's also nothing to suggest that PB is outside the gender binary, either, so you really have nothing to apologize for. Your post was fine.
yeah, but thats pretty much the internet in general. I like these puffer jackets a lot but even if I didn't I wouldn't just be negative about it. 
Noooooo....Oh well.  I'll go ride my own route, with hookers and blackjack...
Amazon is apparently as dark and strange as the rest of the internet.

Me too! Maybe we should get together?
Tattle away. /u/lolabunbun doesn't scare me. 
Nah, Cisco and Caitlin would find you after your third or fourth casino. 
Nope, no fix. You've made it clear you want to talk, he has made it clear he doesn't want to. Perhaps he will change his mind over time, but you just have to respect that for now.
I don't have this problem at all. The problem I do have is the big lit up power button drawing the attention of my 1.5 year old daughter.I'll be in the middle of something and before I know whats happening, "windows is shuting down".
Wouldn't this be private information? Posting someone's name on the sub. 
The next pair of oxfords I get are either Carmina or Enzo Bonafé.I literally never have to wear oxfords, though.
I think tipping 100% does make you stand out, but as my friends int he service industry tell me, you will get better service next time.  I try to tip 30-50%, especially at places I regularly go.
