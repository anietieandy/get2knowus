Case in point: a man mowing the lawn is a beautiful sight :-)
Unfortunately that's unreliable, chocked full of spam, terribly quality and you're SOL if you want to watch the game anytime other than live.
HAHAHAHAHAHA. I was part of this.Can't wait to see the outcome.
I have stretch marks, yes. I've had 2 kids.
2 sets as in, 4x4x2 total of 32 passes over the weekend?
We live in Ottawa. Pretty tame bunch.
God your friend is hot.. He should call me.
Try Emuparadise, they still have GBA roms
This is what I do. I usually just scoop whatever I think I'll need into one of those little snack bags. But I'm a mom and have a huge purse. I've brought it just that way into music festivals and everything and no one has ever said anything about it.
Agreed. These are my current favorite jeans. 
If it is legal, find out if the employer has to add interest to the deposit when they refund you. 
I'd love to believe this but my good friends husband of 18 years recently left her for a younger woman.  
Kewpies.    I'm very selective about them because some are just downright creepy looking in the face.   But all of them are naked, so there's butt cheeks, and some have little a penis and balls (mostly the newer Japanese ones).    
Not only that, but most of the time a woman can do it alone if she has to.
The gays. I've lost friendships with people because they thought I was being bigoted the other way. (Liking the gays because they are gay and not because of who they are as people.) 
I wonder if you could explain that to them if they would let you do that permanently or if they would tell you to work more efficiently in the office.
I'm so sorry for your loss. I really have no idea what to say but please know that we love you and are sending you hugs and support.  
Who makes a 4 year old wet himself just so they don't have to interrupt what they're doing? That seems awful to me! Also your kid calling his blanky "baby daddy" is the best thing ever. EVER. 
Full name is Penelope. Penny is a nickname. :) Victoria is Tori.
More and more I try and I invite people over for things like that. Yeah it means I have to clean up (but I could use the motivation) but my son goes to bed around 8 then I get to drink and have fun too. 
Yay! If there are days that work better for you let me know!
"Sticking his dick in crazy" - charming. 
No. Just no. Please don't misinform people it does not work like that.
Amaterasu. ;_; I'm six plus eggs shy of +297I have tried the hardest of all monsters to max skill her. (Currently at 3)Poor girl. Needs an awaken uevo. 
It doesn't seem useful at all. Stats are low, and the set damage isn't as high as say, 7777 for cheesing through stuff.Just EXP. 
Egbunu is an athletic freak, can't wait to watch him play again.  Hopefully his bball IQ has increased since transferring...he was pretty bad at help D sometimes.  
Catch a train, be witty or funny, follow a certain bricked road...
Ok. I don't really look at dank memes either.
Holy shit. Sticker shock. No freaking way would I spend that much. I used Cosco folding high chairs. Fold up for easy storage/transport but cheap too.
Most doctors say not to even attempt until 6 months.I didn't until 11 months when I realized they weren't actually eating anything from their bottles. They were doing it for attention.
I learned long ago that if I don't have one I would with kill whomever I lived with or a ridiculous amount of trees. I loathe housework but also loathe mess. It is tough being me. Totally kidding, except about the housework. 
I played on ps3 when it came out, but never got any of the dlc so I figured I'd break in my first ever PC with it. 
Ill be the first one to admit if nobody else will that I didnt understand that movie at all when I saw it. It's why I usually don't jump into discussions about it
Possibly PTSD? You sound exhausted with things, but then, you must be working so many hours.
Phyllis from the Office is the closest thing anyone's guessed.
Yes, but what do you make them into?  Pot pie?  Ohhh, I hope it's pot pie.
HS has always had some of the best customer service I've ever encountered- and I don't just mean CS from vendors, I mean ever, with anything. 
I'm very inspired to skip dessert tonight. She's repulsive. 
With all due respect, why are we not banning fat sympathizers?
I'm sorry, how much can you power clean again? 
Apparently women who are not hamplanets are not real women. Despite the fact that we get periods, bear children, etc. we are not real women, and we don't have feelings. We have thin privilege.
Are you fucking kidding me?! Stupid fucking cows. She looks amazing in the second pic. That's inspirational right there. Hell, I'm a straight woman and I'd do her.
Yeah Ned was just happy that Jon took one for the team and he didnt have to bring him to King's Landing. 
I'll watch it again later. I got a phone call and my kid was talking to me so I always miss some of it.
They were drunk and got onto the new guy. It's shitty, but understandable in a way.
I worked at a BK for awhile. As far as I know, we rarely used that sink for anything. We certainly never filled it with water to wash stuff because you'd just assure that everything was sitting in soapy and greasy water.
Cleveland now is above mostly salt thanks to lake deposits.  Not sure about the bed rock further below, but further south a couple miles in Berea it's sandstone with limestone quarry's another 20 miles or so south.
Maybe the SoCal crowd can get her some MAC!
That's fucking sad. So the lady named auntie who ran the daycare out of her home was murdered?  I'm gonna guess the husband wasn't around during the day while she was watching the kids? 
I did Ferber. Took 2 weeks. Amazing results. Used it again when he went through his 18 month sleep regression. Fuck that bitch, if it works do it!
I'm in favor of this. Price tickets at a standard fare for BMIs of 25 or lower. If you have a higher BMI, you pay more based on how much more weight you're bringing on the plane. 
Can you text him that picture ? (sans pants would be even more effective; )
Too skinny, too short. Story of my life. 
I think you're underestimating just how many people cannot cook. At all. Like what might take you or me 15 minutes, they might struggle with for an hour and still not end up with anything edible out of it. They are out there and there are a lot of them.
It was a turning point in our relationship when my dad stopped being father-dad and saw him as friend-dad. Divorce at a you g age and getting moved far away strains things for a while until you can talk to each other as adults. 
**Raja:** Marie Antoinette **Violet:** Death Becomes Her**Manila:** Pineapple Dress**Trinity K. Bonet:** Animal Kingdom Couture **Tyra Sanchez:** "Santino" shopping couture 
Men want her and women want to be her.Me, I mean. I want to be her. Pls
Her definition of yoga is probably corpse pose, then rolling into some sort of sitting position and letting the momentum from her lard pull her to stand, then eating Cheetos.
Apparently the Patriarchy also wants you to be fit and healthy so you can lift your own suitcases and beat the living shit out of anyone who tries to rape you. Oh, wait...
Good thing I don't consider myself skinny. I'm fit.
Cum. Seriously? How is this a question?
I am pretty sure everyone who said January Jones can't act has been eating their hat.
Having similar  50-70 year old teachers teach technology and computer classes to children.  My kids have to help their technology teachers with their laptops.  It's such a waste of education time.
When I was a kid in the 80s there were more stories with him in his nest, talking to Snuffy, walking around Sesame Street. I haven't seen him in any skits.
I haven't seen this :3.Replace the hand gun with the time extend finger
Yup. I was soooo happy when the patch that lets you know the age of the sims when you hover over them came out! But still, teens, young adults and adults are all almost identical.
....she? Huh, I thought it was a he.
Thank you. I was starting to feel like I was fighting a losing battle.
Exactly.  Also all his buddies creeped me after that an attempted to slut shame me. Like that even works on a Dom. LOL
Have you tried Softcups?  They wear and fit like a diaphragm without anything hanging down like a diva cup.  I hated diva cup but love Softcups.  
Samsonite! I was way off...Nah sounds like a word that'd be common up in New England but i've never been to the NorthEast of the US
Bush will be competing with Hayne for a roster spot. Hyde, Hunter and Davis will make it. Bush is basically competing for a return man role. 
Why haven't I thought of this before?!
Oh! So is that what she's doing? I thought it was the same as college in the US, my bad. It's kinda like high school, then? That makes it kinda weirder, I thought she was a freshman in uni. Still doesn't make what happened right, though.
I was thinking "who holds a playstation controller without having fingers on the shoulder buttons"
GET OVER HERE. So I can queef on you.
I have the ability to love everyone. 
Spend time with them and allow others to, as well. Their life is almost over, let them know it is special. As far as grieving, don't ignore the process, but do it in your own way. 
Sex. I can get lost in my thoughts, thinking about sex I've had, or wanted to have.
But they have a solid financial plan: Have a truck load of kids, and say God told you to do it, then get your own reality show.
The Rock and Bad Boys are still awesome moviesAnd i liked The Island, too.
Fuji kahuna, Nana berry, and breakfast. 6mg. Ty!
Oh wow, that was adorable. Thank you, I needed that! :D
Physically, emotionally and even partly biologically I am a completely different person.
It's annoying... When I don't have my purse on me I stuff things in my bra lol 
You are nicodemia.  She married nicodemia, the whole person.  Femme is part of who you are... and so is the tomboy side.  Definitely talk to her about how you do flow back and forth from time to time so she won't be alarmed.  Good luck.
I'm a mom. We're stronger than you think. Most of us older generation have also experienced sexual assault. Your mother is there to help you. 
We have been trying to get our Blue to roll over. He just doesn't like the feeling, I suppose.
Sorry this is like two weeks old but I just got caught up. Are Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch really Hydra creations? And they're twins? (Not much of a comic buff, sorry)
Also, the Guard may hand out boxes of them after a natural disaster. We had a bunch for awhile. But the "excitement" of getting some was just a bit dampened by the 4 feet of water in our house.
#NO. Kennedy + Ginger = Kenn-ger. Also, Ginger + Kennedy = Ging-Eddy?
I don't understand how you lost 5 bundles. Unless you mean in real life. 
The sizing is totally fucked up. I'm an XS in Reebok and Old Navy, and XS Fabletics still fits me fine in bottoms, but the tops are totally fucked. The last tank I ordered in XS fit more like a medium.
Holy shit. 7 hours of straight sleep sounds epic. 
Haha! Yeah I know, picking your battles is so so essential. 
I keep one in my purse and a large one in the car. Can never have too many!
Thanks! (Just saw your edit).  Let me see what she says today, if anything. If I don't hear by, say 2 pm, I'll email her and let her know more action is being taken if I don't hear something by 5 PM 
Also crazy coupon promotions would be good, too, something where you earn gift cards back (like at Target) but your out of pocket is low, earning a nice profit with each transaction.
[What's the difference](http://www.swagbucks.com/?f=51&amp;t=w&amp;p=1&amp;q=aditude)? 
Haha ive never seen that but it takes what i said and puts it way better. 
Oh shit, my bad. I was just browsing /r/all. Didnt realize i was in /r/teenagers
This is really creepy. They left the door unlocked so I believe they were there on purpose waiting for someone alone to come in. 
What are we supposed to fing with fingers and what exactly is finging anyway. 
I think there's a few! I'm about 45 min away in kitchener waterloo but close enough!
read what, learn what, live what?
Hahaha! "Did I lose my bladder control for this?"
Hello, I am Mr. Gentleman. Huzzah to meet you! Would you kindly pass the caviar and ketchup? 
It's like wedding invitations for your graduation 
You're under estimating how many people world wide want to live here. You build a million houses, there are easily 100 million who can still out-bid locals. 
I think you need to boot him out. 
Until she gets pregnant and you feel like you have to stay with her in order to see your kids? Or that could just be the norm in my shitty town.
Because I have no idea what that says.
Someone's been in here and downvoting. Hi, fatty!
Ok, neither of those bods are hot. One on the left needs a little muscle.That said, I'm so glad to see backlash. Now we just need more HAES backlash, instead of Tess Fucking Monster on the cover of People.
I guess, I mean... A Vikings fan would think that was impressive lol
Ahaha, oh my god.  When is city dog's? 
Good news! My shitlord husband and I, along with our mini-shitlord and mini-shitlady, will be in Houston to bring down the average weight later this year. 
I do basically the opposite of a speed run when I play mgs3. I crawl everywhere and tranq the bosses
Way better looking than Taco Bell nachos. 
Michelle has that mom look like 'girl, if you were my kid, i would tan that hind end for you...'
I grew up on a farm.  We always left hay out on Christmas Eve for the reindeer as children.  I was in college before I realized that this was not something all kids did.  I felt stupid for never even realizing most kids would not have hay on hand.
He wasn't her boyfriend.  He was a waiter she knew from a restaurant she frequented who was returning a pair of glasses her mother left at the restaurant.
I once went off on someone on the commuter rail who sat half of her lard in my lap. "You owe me for half my ticket, dammit, and you know what? It would do you some good to stand and burn some calories."
Interesting idea, but don't most poor people rent?
She'll always be my favorite punk goth evil witch
He had a little foray with his Moray if ya know what i mean
I'm not entirely sure what you're asking but if you haven't seen the movie, these aren't going to make much sense. 
Tshirt quilts are the ugliest things.  I know, memories and all that stuff but, seriously, they are almost universally ugly.
A store makes you look more professional. People may trust that your items aren't scratched, etc if you look like a pro rather than someone having a garage sale online. Make sense? 
Received 2-$100 GCs today and one "Device Received" email.
Definitely smaller, but it can get pretty packed.  I always have a good time, I'd say it's a nice mix of people.  I also like it cause you can show up dressed super fancy, or in jeans.
No, just no! But have a good time otherwise: )
You probably shouldn't open an umbrella in the shower, even if you are trying not to get wet since its bad luck, on account of it being indoors.
I think some people actually call it that. My family did.
Holy fucking shit me too. Also mascots in full animal costumes. 
Good instincts!  That's the family.
My friend is pretty hot though, I'd let her try it on me but our situations never got us together in that way. Didnt think about a girl choking on it. 
Just curious, what is "bottle broke"? 
Cool, I'll look into this. Thanks!
They were never activated and didn't come with minutes like some others said theirs did.  I used Wifi only.  
Only since November? It's not a guarantee... I'd say if she was on the year mark of all 0s you'd be better off. 
If I heard a kid call a parent "dah" I'd assume it's short for "dah-ddy." It's not the most stealth nickname imo.. "Mah" would probably be more ideal
I don't really care for them... I think they're kinda stupid and don't fully understand their appeal to others but recognize and use that appeal... Because.. You know... Guys are hot lol
Why does Kennedy look so depressed?
Lol, I won 5k too.  Total scam.
Are you part of the rap group Nanner Puddin? 
It just seemed like he blinked to me.
The longevity of fast food doesn't exceed 20 min, usually.
Haha, I know. I was just kidding!
I found the whole series online and watched it. Mostly as a refresher, since we get Showtime every January and then cancel it when Shameless is over.
She's stretching those bottoms to their limits.
Haha oops, thanks! I'm on my phone, sorry!
Hmmm...I suppose I could have walked around the store with him, pointing out the various "it"s that I know the location of.  See, I KNEW I was a horrible person for not helping him!
Oh OK. Today I saw a guy in a smart car...he looked like he barely fit. Not cute.  I guess a truck to me means working with your hands, fishing, and helping someone move. All good things in a guy to me anyway. 
Been through that.Lots of talking and lots of playing. Seriously. Your kid will have a blast. And you'll just talk. Easy peasy.
TURN OUT GAY?!?!?! May I come along? Just to punch her. 
My son clogs the toilet more than I do! It's absurd! Thank god for cloth diapers holding disturbingly huge amounts of shit. 
Wow, get the fuck out of here with that kind of talk.Unverified scum.
No, she wants a break so she can go do whatever but know that you'll still be there waiting. 
Be my guest to add it to /r/frisson  : )
I believe they have fully bought into their own bullshit. 
They could all be child molesters but still be heroes to fundys.  It's a Duggar repentance win. 
If I wasn't married, I might let you!
&gt; Fresh off the Tumblr boat/local middle school busFresh off the Tumblr boat/local middle school short busFTFY
I was like "wait.. what??" then I realized you're ftm.. I'm stupid lol
You need to call the cops. This kid is sick. 
Maybe it's a bag of dicks. That would probably be easier.
They get MORE stubborn than they are at 2?!Excuse me I'll be off killing myself. 
Nah, the go fund me says she's getting better and even has a feeding tube now, gotta keep those sugahs up!
good for you.  i will be getting some, thank you.is it available at like health food stores?
Ooooh I always went with a variant called "Smart, Pretty, Sane" But I like yours because it's easier. I'll take hot and sane and challenge the other suitor to a duel and win her heart. Easy peacy^11. Compared to restoring sanity 
You don't learn how to juggle by picking up 20 balls at once.
A teacher is probably in contact with lots of children every day, an oil change technician is not. 
Bananas are delicious in smoothies.  Banana creme pie is yummy too.  I also like that frozen banana dipped in chocolate thing on a stick that you can get at Disneyworld.  
I just thought it would be fun to read a couple of these at the shower. I'm a mom. I know about too much advice.
I'm guaranteeing you that if he posts about his girlfriend "overdoing" her makeup, says he prefers her without makeup/looking natural, or in any way insinuates that he doesn't love her makeup, they will attack him.
The instant he starts up with you shut down your computer and leave the room. I know it sucks to leave a game mid way but he will stop being an arse. 
I mean, when someone makes awesome plans for me and shows up with flowers and chocolate, my favorite way to thank them is to yell at them, splash them with water, and choke them.Are you fucking kidding me? 
"Thank you.""Think you!""Thank you.""Think you!"/Tatianna
The religious people who think they're doing good by preventing a "baby" from being "killed".
There are several different ways to put in implants. If you have a good plastic surgeon they can make the scars minimal, and they'll eventually fade.
Dispatcher here. It was probably 911.
He kind of is, though. He is the biggest name in boxing whether you like it admit it or not. And it's Foreman and Ali. 
My son's middle name is Terran. I always liked Terra for a girl.
Seriously! "I am on this social website, yet I have no clue how to interact socially." Ugh!!
Best in Show is in that group of movies like For Your Consideration and A Mighty Wind. Same actors and director. 
I don't know who this guy is and that makes me feel really good about myself. 
She's currently being seen weekly by a therapist. She goes to see a psych once a month, but that's only for med renewals. There are not many people around here who are "child psychiatric"   
I'm just saying I wouldnt day Bama choked, even if they did lose. It was a good game there just some things that came together better for Ohio State. I was nervous up until the very end. 
Kiss them. Talk to them about being in a relationship. 
Breast buds forming.. Look up the tanner stages
I lived those books as a kid, was never into realistic fiction
Don't know the guy w/ the clarinet in his nose...but the 3 others seemed legit. http://imgur.com/beBXXtq,Rfj8SjP,SK2OXFF,3X135rc
Wtf? In loco parentis means nothing then, if you can't physically grab a student to stop them from beating the shit out of another student. I thought that's what it was for, to act in the best interest of the child in place of the parent.
I have 9/30 of the top 30. One of which is Liu Bei which I can afford to have a dupe of. I am rather surprised by Amaterasu!!! I dont see many people using Amaterasu at all where are all these people?
What makes an N each out after years of nc? HIS MOTIVES DON'T MATTER! HOW DARE YOU QUESTION ME? 
IUD and morning after pill work the same way.
Money, so we can spend it on whatever we please later on. And a nice homemade card to accompany it.
It will be over soon.  In the mean time Zantac might help.  It's totally safe.  My Dr prescribed it for my first and I've used it will all my babies.  Stops the acid production and kills heartburn before it even starts.  
My buddy proposed with a taco bell packet. So there's that
That's is so sweet. I'm a mom, and I got teary eyed. I'm sure it means so much to her. 
I think much of it is frozen. You know, like prison food.
I like bacon by itself, but I'm not into the trend of putting bacon on everything. 
Me too. Fucking gross. Blood smells bad as it is...
My daughter's best friend went to buy a fish recently. She had the name for the fish all picked out an everything.She now has a cute little black female kitty named "Puddles"
Or go diving into a toilet one of your kids forgot to flush. GAG!!
I was friends with his sister who was a few years older. But yea, we spoke, I wouldn't say 'close' or anything.
My cat prefers to be the only cat in the house, she is currently attacking my mom's new kitten. No one is getting hurt and we will be moving in 5weeks. Then she will definitely be an only cat for the rest of her life. 
I've read stories of people going on hormones for 10 years then stopping for 8-9 months to conceive and starting again. There's not much research on this but your passibility with surgery alone won't be very good unless you're one of very lucky few.
I want to hear your story as collection of sentient rock. What race, and what character class would that be good for?
Yeah I had a ridiculous ratio of gold to not good. Even got silvers that looked decent. Definitely counting my blessings. Funny thing is, I pulled a LuBu and Chef finally pulled DQXQ, so we may end up actually using each other's friends in the end :) 
So pretty! I love how soft it looks.
Ugh, I know.  I wish I had devoted the whole day to nothing but requesting envelopes.  Next time I will!
I guess. It just makes sense to tell you something by starting out with what I ate for breakfast. 
Thank you! It's so true. I struggle with how I look but then I remember that the important part is that I'm healthy, I'm a single mom, I work full time, and I make sure my son is fed well and clothed. Thpse are the things that are more important. 
Yup. The other parents need to know.
I guess I just figured they would have found a replacement who could do the voice. Did they replace Elmo's voice actor/puppeteer after the scandal?
Are there any addresses on the birth certificate?
They are a popular group that just does dance covers to kpop songs.  It's sad when you start recognizing dance cover groups.  
I hate work dreams. You work all fucking night and then get up in the morning and go to real work. 
You probably shouldn't smoke a day before you start... It'll still be in your system.
I agree, we all have those moments. Last week I signed my husband's name instead of my own and sent an email money transfer to myself instead of rent. Oops...
Noooooo I don't believe you. :3 take a picture of your hand! 
How do you even have a sex drive at that weight? Aren't your hormones all fucked up?
Guaranteed those comments are other fat women who have been involved in previous fat circle jerks with betty buttergolem.
Not gonna down vote you, but I am unaware that he is a racist.  
No. I do not agree to disagree. I am just done with this conversation.
It was at the top of the stairs and fell down while I was walking down them.
My friend's mom passed away last night so I'll have a funeral to go to this week.
Where do you live? Cuuuuuz that's so not legal where I live! 
Holy crap you are impressively strong. *Hugs* I'm sorry you are going through this. 
I have nightmares about what you're going through. No siblings or help?
Fucking shut up already Kenn-ger.
Wow. How do you keep from beating him?
Well, if he doesn't become president he can certainly be the next Captain Obvious.
Ditto. When it's fresh, it's lovely, comforting, warming, and makes everything better. When it's bad, it's disgusting.
Theyre fairly normal I guess. I guess about as big as a thumb nail on average. People probably just see crane flies, aka mosquito hawks, and probably think it's a giant mosquito. Those things are fairly large and look a lot like a mosquito. 
Nic cage probably got at least a million or two, right? Right?
I enjoyed that timeline post that explained all the time travel episodes and dimensional travel in Paul Blart 2. Really cleared some things up.
If you keep your showers ice cold, your body will make up for the carbs by burning fat to raise your core temperature.  Fact. 
Nope. He gave her quite the talking-to, from what I heard, and told her that one more comment would mean she was banned. 
Women are 50% of the population you got a problem with that
I would make sweet love to that Black Cowboy in a pool of his own barbeque sauce. 
Everyone knows Jon Snow's brother was killed by the Mountain
Kick your legs and push down with your arms.  It isn't effortless but it's not difficult with practice.  It's one of those things that's easy and instinctive if you learn as a young kid but tough to master as an adult.  
Yes, and I kiss my kids on the lips.
I had rectus abdominals, which means my abs tore. I had a 3 inch gap between them. While its closed up a lot, the only way to fully fix it is plastic surgery. Then there's the extra skin and stretch marks. Sigh. Oh well!
I support legalization of prostitution, in hopes of getting it off the streets and regulating it. Medical testing, taxation, etc. could help the economy, as well as provide protections for sex workers.
My friend was completely hooked on that shit for like 3 years. It was crazy.
My husband was balding at 25 when I met him.  He was and is still hot and it's never bothered me. 
"Did your mother have any children that lived?"
This deserves way more upvotes than it got. Tim Russert helps the state of Louisiana dodge a bullet.
Add ghost pepper powder for more fun.
Man those transitions look seemless
If you really don't want to go out add shredded carrots instead diced ones. Maybe add a little bit more salt/seasoning too.  Most people won't notice too much. 
Good lord, really? I've never bought bay leaves. I just went outside and picked them.
Thank you for your honest answer. We are discussing this option now and will def take this into account.Best of luck to you..
What the FUCK kind of grandparents does this????
Those meat chickens die after6 months anyway even if not eaten. Laying hens though would be just fine.  Some breeds would out survive others, but my layers routinely sneak off and hatch babies so I know they can keep the species going.
True. Sonic corndogs are weird compared to real corndogs. 
This is a pretty good channel.  Thx for sharing. 
Corporations. And I became a fan watching JR race in Phoenix when he won 2 years in a row because I lived there.  I didn't even know who he was or his dad...not a bandwagon fan. Just a person that fell in love with the sport decades ago. 
Please keep in mind some people seriously don't know and will ruin their lives based off this advice. This isn a joke sub.
You could try [second life](http://secondlife.com). It's free and you can work on your voice.. There's support groups inside it too.
Open the door and talk to them. Tell them you know God's name is Jehovah. Always worked for me at any address. It's like they marked me off their list. 
I grew up with many farm cars.  When you hear those shrieking noises, they are not fighting.
Ohhh, nice!  Thanks for the info!
Ooooh so cool :) I don't have appropriate dark subs yet.....definitely hoping for some come PCGF
I keep the ones I don't have full size of. Feed when I have full size. Shame. So cute...
Thank you. I think that is an excellent policy. 
Thanks, after reading all the comments and looking into it a little more, in leaning towards springs. I appreciate everyone's input:)
So cute! Best of luck to you two, I hope you have a great time together :)
All grey cat would be my dream kitty as well.....I have always wanted one named Tapioca. :)
I'm fighting all of them.  Whether or not they'll be resolved, who knows.  Here's a thread I started about communicating with them: http://www.reddit.com/r/VerizonTradeIn/comments/352042/communicating_with_executive_relations_is_beyond/
“Here is a lesson in creative writing. First rule: Do not use semicolons. They are transvestite hermaphrodites representing absolutely nothing. All they do is show you've been to college.”― Kurt Vonnegut, A Man Without a Country 
Damn! Breaking even! Sorry Man!
Me too, so I just stop talking sometimes.  You tell me your story and I'll just appreciate it.
Agreed. He's a sorry excuse for a dad, and frankly, I'm flummoxed at all the people saying otherwise. Good fathers do not knowingly and willingly compromise their children's well-being. 
Holy... what the shit is that?!
Oh, man, I have nightmares like that.  I'm glad you survived!
Ah, that's what they said!  They didn't like Whoz That Girl, which I still love.
I've had 15 sessions of LHR... I pay about $20/session and go once a month. I'll probably never stop going lol.... I saw optimal results around 10-11 sessions. At this point I have less than my cis friends
Wear good socks &amp; shoes. Bring bandaids in case of blisters, especially if it's a long hike.
Those are absolutely stunning. 
awwww so cool =( i'm guessing you live in JP?
:D I can't bring myself to hate him either, even though he eats all my food. I love him more now that I have expanded the yard to have a second bowl. 
I thought I was constipated and I kept pushing. It turns out I was in labor. 
I mean, I got to feed a freaking giraffe, pet a baby camel, and get really close to this weird pink spoonbill thing (which is another new favorite animal), so I was pretty stoked.
Haha.. I hear you. I once told someone and they sat down and were like "noo" ... It was as if I made them question everything they thought they knew about gender and at that very moment their mind had blown.
If they're like, really young I guess it sucks? I noticed a dramatic increase in my quality of life once my kid was out of diapers. 
A close friend had gallbladder surgery. It's rough but so much better than many other causes of chest pain! Here's hoping he's back to normal soon!
If he is hitting on me, he is very single.
I don't understand your comment, she was just talking about her experience.
That's not a terrible lesson to appreciate something gave its life for your dinner.
I've never seen this movie. But wow holy shit that was embarrassing to watch. 
So gross!Just because they're boobs doesn't mean they're automatically sexy. 
I just want to say you missed me screaming,  1000 miles and a confederate railroad song. 
Robb wasnt trying to rule King's Landing.
That whole "dear mom on your iPhone" thing that went around.  Who ever wrote that deserves my kids for at least a week.  Sometimes you cling to whatever gets you through the day.  
Won't somebody think of the children!?!
They called Ethan Lupus Dei which means Wolf of God. That's pretty fitting for a protector Wolfman who can perform on-the-fly exorcisms. 
Hard Space: Science Fiction Opera
To be fair, you asked her and she told you, and you cheaped out and tactlessly told her it was too pricey for a first date. How much could it possibly be? It can't be much more than a normal dinner and a movie date.
You could try [Swagbucks](/www.swagbucks.com/refer/hattopper). You can even do it from your smartphone or tablet, and there are so many ways to do it, besides surveys. Hope this helps.
One of my friends hasn't vaccinated her daughter. It actually scares me. Especially because I have a toddler. 
if dads could stop being creepily involved in their daughters' sex lives, that'd be great    YOU BETTER NOT FULFILL THAT BASIC HUMAN NEED YOU HEAR ME, I WAS A HORRIBLE PERSON TO GIRLS AT YOUR AGE!!
&gt; Sarah says "yeah, all the guys who seem interested in me are weirdos and losers".Really? Perhaps it is time to look at the common denominator. 
Food processors not farmers.  Bakers, meat packers etc were adding non food.  Not farmers.
OP is a member of the Andorran Ministry of Propaganda
Stay healthy guys. One can always reach out anonymously. There may be a lot of you among us. 
The lyrics are sickening. Where's the part where she mentions what she's bringing to the relationship?
Obviously from my previous comment I am aware of that. But why the fuck even have it if people are getting ticketed for using it for just that reason? 
If you have the energy to get through it on an empty stomach then there is no harm. If not, a small serving of something carby will help. 
The game is called NekoAtsume. You have a backyard. You leave out food and a toy. Cats may or may not come. It's a game you have to turn off to "play". Basically it's a lava lamp. With cats. 
That is seriously rude. What a bitch. Do not let her lack of social graces make you feel embarrassed. She should be the one cringing in hindsight, not you. 
Pretty much any remix of the "[Eat Da Poo Poo](https://youtu.be/Deq0qOfRNC0)" video.This remix is my favorite. [DJ Horsey Horse BOOM BOOM remix](https://youtu.be/J1X7I1YJwqk)
I'm going to show this to my sister.  She has had tooth pain for months now, but doesn't want to pay to get it looked at. Maybe if I convince her that her skull will die, she'll go to the damn dentist.
&gt;  (UNLESS that he really isn't worried about you leaving and it's instead something else. This is always a possibility.)Possibly. His parents are both in the medical field, so it might be a medical concern.
Ive heard it's actually the noodles that have the sodium
I'm half Mexican with some Filipino and Native American Indian and just a tad Irish and French. People assume I'm Mexican or Italian. 
My husband swears by store-brand Mountain Dew knock offs.
You've defeated me, I'd love a vacation! Where ya planning on?
You look great. I mean for a cow.. Health at every size! 
Have they disapproved from the beginning? 
Them are some banana hands. I bet he could palm a bowling ball.
Maybe both their daughters weren't diagnosed before the 3rd was born? 
Ouch - hope she gets better soon.
Everyone is gonna be so pissed when we're traveling the stars with space jesus and everyone else is left behind because they didnt believe in aliens. 
When I was a kid in the 60s, we had something like this - you put it on a stove burner, turned the burner on and did one side at a time. Ours was not as fancy as this one, though!
Well your coach is a nutbar so you got that goin for ya
Every dude who eats bagel bites with ranch dressing, is now retching for their life with tears in their eyes. 
#HAAA! I'm sorry that was funny!
I've thought of doing the same thing as well.... :/ Maybe after PCGF? 
Does he have rabies and can smell when women are on their periods? He may be Buster Casey. 
Yup! In movies/TV shows/etc, "te quiero" is always translated as "I love you", but it definitely doesn't mean that, "te amo" does. But "te quiero" doesn't really mean "I like you" either - that's "me gustas". It just has no translation!
Why? A lot of my cats like that thing. They have a lot of different ways to play with it and its great for photo ops
I....cannot.....stop....laughing. 
&gt; Ugly AmericansI loved this show! The demon chick was funny as hell....Callie! Mark, not so much.
That would be totally surreal to wake up almost two months later. At least all the hard work of losing 60lb already happened, that's a pretty good reset button of turning your life around
You're not wrong. This is one of the reasons I hate politics, period. They're all so interested in maintaining an image, but it's all a lie. Their motivations for doing things are lies. Hate it.
So cool! I don't own a single iDevice but thank you for sharing. Please let me know if you ever make an Android port:D
They do make a sailor moon one, I would buy it.  No shame.
When you tie or take the lead, then shut the other team down in the following inning. Serves to maintain momentum for your team.
I don't know but we're all still alive, so it's probably not too dangerous. :-)
I thought you'd be into texts about your shapely cerebellum and swollen medulla oblongata. 
Yes it is. That is why my own children will not be exposed to him. I'm going to do the protecting my own mother was too blind to do. 
I want to be the minorityDown with your fatass majority'Cause I want to be the minority
I feel there is more to this story?
Ive know too many people with dogs named Belle for that ever to be an option for me
I totally walked around my domicile shouting "BITCH!" Pinkman style for a good 5 minutes. Okay maybe not shout. Definitely super happy though. So glad I insisted on zero stoning. 
If you love your body, you don't cram it full of crap.
They forgot to hyphenate Spider-man. How embarrassing. 
I actually am just thrilled that GSUSA is allowing any child who identifies as female to be involved. What an excellent step towards equality and understanding!
But yup, fat girls have huge boobs... Her areolas are bigger than my boobs srsly
Back tits at Wal-mart. I'm so not surprised. 
You are pretty much THE best friend. Keep being you
Congratulations!!!  I wish you the best. Now you can work on your healing on your terms. Good luck. And keep us updated, we care about you. 
Hahahaha!!!Fat people don't need help, the need to stop eating so much! It really is that simple.
Work the pounds away with strenuous exercise!
&gt;obesity—a terrible word, by the way, because it’s patronizingly clinical, and only used by doctors or non-fat people intent on making fat people feel terrible about themselvesCareful. Using medical terminology might hurt their fee-fees.
You can support LGBT rights and still be part of the Catholic church. It's very similar in my country - same-sex marriage is legal, sex-change surgery and hormonal therapy are legal rights and free. Yet the country is Catholic by a big majority.
Nah it's French or Italian. If he is really good he might get some Greek. 
I am 5'2" currently 158 lbs and I eat around 2000 a day. I am still losing weight. 
/u/doubledickdude has two dicks bigger than mine
Funny how that guy went from JAG officer to auctioneer in five seconds flat.
The guy that plays Cain is the same guy that plays Detective Lassiter on Psych.I miss Chuck. I hope they bring him back to the show at some point. 
You mean you don't like being crushed if she tries to climb on top, or having to push her FUPA out of the way, or rolling her in flour to find the wet spot? Shocking! Guys like athletic sex. Wow. News flash.
I keep see them liken it to heroin and all I can think is "Wow. If this is like heroin then heroin must be a lot milder than I thought because it's really no big deal."
She's attractive in a weird sort of way. But i've liked her in everything i've seen her in
Everyone says that there are better kbbq places up there, but I like Honey Pig's more casual atmosphere.   Plus they play kpop videos on the tvs. :3 
I bet they run through the streets, winking at freaks. With a 2-liter stuck in their butt cheeks. 
It is a streaming service from Fox Sports.  It is an app so you can see games on your smart phone or ipad.  Some people like it but I haven't had a lot of success with it. 
omg noooo... armadillos are so annoying for your yard but they're so cute T___T
I don't usually cook for hangovers. Checker's used to be my go-to hangover food. Someone would go and just get a bag full of burgers and we'd eat them slowly all day. Worked great.
My SO is like that always, but he checked with me before our first date if I was okay with it. I really like it.
I've suspected that, too. I keep asking him if that's what he's worried about, and he's like, "Nope." Not that I expect him to tell me outright, but I am trying to let him know I do suspect this.
Reading, working out, washing dishes, and sometimes just watching funny YouTube videos. 
So true. Although I did want this $1000 Kirby that i wouldn't complain if I got. Any ther model though and I hear Ya! 
Why even vaccinate against scarabs? When was the last time you even saw a scarab? All it's going to do is introduce health risks towards your kids.
Yeah, but you're taken.  Cousin maybe?  LOL
Yes, I'm under 5K and thanks for explaining this for everyone.  My only question though, is would I be able to do this in my home state?
No.. I don't get it. Put on your big girl pants and just tell them.
I had a Rottweiler that would let my then boyfriend's 3 year old son *stomp* on her ears and tail, try to ride her like a horse, etc. Probably because he shared all of his food with her, lol.
&gt;99 stamina one drop.that's disgusting. 
Hmmmm I don't have Yamato Takeru. Let me see if I have another fast fire orb changer handy. 
I actually found it really useful to read for just how to play LMeta in general It's a whole different approach to playing that I'm not used to. But yes I can see why I would have confused someone haha sorry
And yet these people are still playing. If a free to download game is terrible, just delete it and move on. :/ Such is the marvellous time we live in. 
Since my husband is still much in, my almost 13 year old is, because of me, is getting quietly shunned by the kids she's known since birth and even cousins, I don't think she even knows it's happening. How do I explain this to her? 
I wonder if the farmer may be suffering from CO poisoning.
You look absolutely healthy and lovely! Congrats. :-) Fiber has been of huge importance in my own weight loss as well, and so has liking myself. 
Bill Paxton is my spirit animal.
It was the tight clothes they had her in and the long hair. Since then she's had kinda bland unsexy clothes and the super short hair that I felt really nerfed her look. 
I said I did this on a thread and no one believed me that that was possible. 
Holy fuck, dude! I usually say therapy, but do what you have to. Before you go, take some time to do some solitary hiking. Check out the beautiful scenery. It would suck to leave this life and have to say you never bothered to see the sites.
Do you like  it? Do you miss any of the off-road rugged sportiness of it? It looks really nice.
I took a poll online years ago somewhere that showed you different pictures and you had to guess. It was pretty derogatory and I was awful at it apparently.To my knowledge, nothing tasteful has been made.
Most women I know are against abortion :/ Had to hide plenty of people on FB because they kept sharing anti-abortion sutff.
You would if the damn thing didn't work for shit. I clean mine all the time and still hate it. The only reason I have it is because my husband had it before we were married.
If only my mom knew this when pregnant for me.
Oh my god. That's just an awful combination. I'm going to be spending it working a 12 hour day with kids who aren't mine, and not getting even a card from my son's dad - who is taking his new wife away for the week. Let's drink together in spirit. 
I remember being back in the US for a few weeks when one day I just didn't poop like 6 times. But it took weeks. 
I'm verified. I run sub-2 hour half marathons and lift weights.
For awhile, yes, I became very outgoing. But then I lost my job and all of my friends with it.
He loves me. He just has trouble admitting when he's wrong lol
Under my girls' chairs are the cleanest areas in our house.
Exactly, if he was in any discomfort he would be flipping out. Little dogs especially let you know if they're unhappy with something. 
My son is half white half salvadoran, now I'm hoping the salvadoran side wins and he'll be able to dance. 
I think it is worth trying IMHO. I had to have one reinstalled as it were. If I was hiding it from my folks I would say I had an irregular pap and need to go get it done again. 
I now want a shirt that says: Egregious Kittens
I liked that movie. Marion Cotillard is off the chain
What? Vaccines are excellent. They are so necessary. 
Fabletics gave into that, too - they made their XXS and XS sizes 1/2 inch larger.
This comment is great because I too lived near PCH and golden west so the visuals were all the more vivid. 
Not a MFP user, or a juice drinker, but I eat copious amounts of fruit. And grains and nuts. I might be a hamster. 
Lol, best player in the world?  Nice layup bro
&gt;And tbh the more I talk to a girl the less I can non-guiltily fantasize about themI see your point. Once you really get to know someone, a lot of those fantasies fade.
TLC financed their breeding operation. Speaking engagements at churches/conservative organizations will keep the cash flow going. 
I laugh involuntarily when I'm nervous, or excited, or really really happy. My husband would get so mad if I laughed during sex, even though I explained many times that I wasn't maliciously laughing at his dick or whatever. Just can't help it sometimes. 
Yeah there was no hint of rape about that. Just rough sex
At that point he is part of the problem. 
For a thirtieth birthday it isn't a big deal. 
The foreshadowing hits you over the head pretty hard this season. People that werent spoiled probably didnt see the Red Wedding coming at all but these ancillary characters getting screen time and character moments definitely have Walking Dead syndrome
&gt; binned knickers/r/Bandnames 
Dragic, Wade, Deng, Bosh, Whiteside.  someone turn the injury slider off
At that size her doc is not fat shaming her. He's looking out for the baby's health. Hams have high risk pregnancies - that's science, not fat shaming. 
Sure, but I would want to know exactly *what* he meant so that I knew exactly how much to be offended. 
youre being downvoted because this isn't always true.. Most areas.. Not all. 
Forgot what I clicked on, was talking to my son. I kept glancing at the pic thinking, "what is going on with the dark red one?" I just want to push it back. I see now.
I have a graphite mark in my thigh - 22 years and still there!
Kirkland Signature, sunny select, equate, up and up. 
I was 23. I only have one daughter. So far so good. I learned what not to do from my parents and I really do have a good kid. She is sweet, generous, and funny. I get a lot of help though from my mom and mother in law so I can't take all of the credit. 
It's weird, isn't it? Why the older guys? I never understood it myself.
A woman walked by talking to someone. I overheard her. Six year old me looks at mom and asks "Mommy, what's an Ass?"
Breathing slowly. Thinking positive thoughts. I know it sounds too simple, but it works. Think of something completely different than what is getting you all worked up. 
Early 20's, but he was *supposed* to be the 'hot older man', almost 40. I guess that should have been a clue.
In some of the US, we call that a bun. Some call it a hamburger bun.
Phew - thought it was a kitten removed from a cuterebra!
Holy crap - sorry to hear about that. 
Era blanco leche. Difícilmente iba a encontrar minas más blancas que él ~~en Argentina~~
I really liked the greyjoy chapters
You have no idea how much this idea has been helping me the past few months. You're awesome BFF!
Apparently, we're not the only ones hurting. I just found this on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=burketrenholm&amp;src=typd). Everyone on the freakin' internet bookmarked the same link!
Ha! Thanks. Corrected his birth!
I hadn't thought about the control thing. Which could very well be the case.   If that's what she's going for, I'm not sure what response she's trying to get.  Um congrats on being creepy?   
Yep. She looks like she's well into her 40s.
Thanks so much! I'll see what I can find
I realize we are mad at them, but they do this each year?  If so, I'll be stockpiling brand new phones when they come up for $5 again.  Only brand new ones though, I dare them to reject those.
God they suck so much.  I hope that if she doesn't reply favorably, that you intend to report them to every relevant agency/social media/etc.  I probably will.
I grow my own food. A few cents for a packet of seeds, repurposed plastic bottles from products I already bought, and a little dirt, water, time and attention, and I don't have to buy produce all summer.
I just saw that for the first time last week
Okay, we just tried some stickers. He grasped putting them on paper right away but also is teething so bad, they ended up in his mouth too much for my comfort zone.
How terrible. Does she remember them? My boy remembered nothing at all about his night terror.
Chardonnay with diet 7-up.  Classy. 
Care to elaborate? How many years did you do auction before switching back?
Did someone hurt you? Would you like a healing spell?
I've tried to do it many times and always wind up binging. I've used intuitive eating to be able to eat sweets moderately, and that worked very well. 
I think so. Stupid fucking piece of shit vacuum. I wanted to throw it out a window but I didn't want to have to pay for a new window.
The first time I sold a large lot of books I shipped priority mail instead of media mail and it cost a fortune. 
In my experience, if I'm not sad after a breakup it's one of two things... Either it was truly for the best (seems to be your case) or I'm still on the "high" of ending the relationship and then I crash and burn a couple months down the road. 
Group therapy really helped me get over my rape. But it took years. I wish I had a sister like you but then again I was lucky enough to have my mom and dad's support. *Hugs* 
My students final papers this year were arguments. One of my student had a pretty great argument for arming teachers with guns.
How do you guys tune out tutorials like this? :D 
Because Kanye hurts their fee-fees. 
I was gilded in a place that may, or may not exist.
GRRM said himself that Coldhands isn't Benjen
Why does she have 4k followers? Gross
WHAT. .....wow. Mystery solved. Thanks. O_o The dumbest part is that I started calling it Chronological in my head too, but never made the connection to the short form still.
I would have literally died if that happened.   
Gotta remember to breathe here...
My brother is 34 and still lives with my parents.
Yay chibi valk!! :D That's really cool, congratulations!
Exactly. Everyone likes their own brand. 
Byebye Pikachu :) Thank you for all your hard work up to now. You will be missed dearly Best of luck IRL. May all your endeavours be rewarded with rainbow eggs and all your efforts result in skill ups. 
&gt;Given my job, I couldn't just flat out call out their racismI do."Ma'am/Sir, being black isn't suspicious, so please tell me what is suspicious about this person."I can't refuse their call for service, but I don't put up with their shit.
Damn straight.. I'm a mom, who has time for this crap?
Yeah I remember seeing the first one in theaters. So many squealing tires in the parking lot and at traffic lights afterwards.
I think i don't like auburn at all. Gus is alright though
My takeaway from this is not about cancer or death.   It's friendship.   I hope to have a friend like Dane and be a friend like Dane. 
Or "oh god what's wrong with it? Please go get it checked. I don't think they're supposed to look like that".
Let's just say 16 or so? We were both idiots.  As we both got older, his lexicon never really improved lol
Oh wow I forgot about those drinks! Fat hand has tainted my childhood memory :(
And a vagina that doesn't repel sex partners because it is literally full of shit.
Be glad you dodged that bullet.
That's just the thing...he looked maybe 35 or 40.  My first thought was that this was some shopper's husband and he mistook me for his wife, but then he glared at me and said "Figures!" when he walked off.  
Pretty much how I see things.  However, I do complain sometimes, because I'm human. You have no idea how much it irritates people when I become less stressed in stressful situations. So much fun.    
Don't put words in my mouth, please. I said no such thing, nor insinuated it. 
you're not using enough makeup [look how i did it](https://imgur.com/L63nkr3)
Holy shit this is exactly something my husband would do and this would have been my EXACT response. Do not fuck with the plants!! 
Maybe the one end links to another butt plug like an ass-to-ass bff necklace
Or God just didnt like her anyway
Just start with "hi" or "hello". If we like each other, the rest will take care of itself. Relax already.
That just happened to me. My son does not get much screen time at all but I let him eat watch the wiggles when we drive to visit family each week. Went 9 GB over my data package. Now I'm shopping for a car DVD player. 
and you can make the words as large as you need them.
The Kardashians are horrible people, but marketing geniuses.
have my husband eat a raisin. He hates them but we'd half the money. So, I think he'd do it.
Man two weeks ago I would have made bank with this guy. 
Yep, it doesn't work out very well.
Oh! I've never been in a unisex bathroom. It's just weird to me to think that a guy will have his junk there in a urinal when ladies can pass by and take a peek haha
Idk but the 100 meters away weren't good enough derections. 
Which people? Most people couldnt tell you who directed either.
