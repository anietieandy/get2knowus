You're talking about a game called grand theft auto that discourages grand theft auto. Dont expect too much.
Fair enough, it's just a bad look for any country to have to have troops patrolling the streets. Especially here, given the circumstances.
My old middle school had up and down stair cases. It was probably the one thing they did right.
The government are the people. intellectual dishonesty is the currency of the modi fanboys
It's entirely possible to know how good Kanye is but still make that statement. He is a true narcissist. I like him, though. He's always entertaining.
So? He's carrying a gun.It's one of our founding rights in the Bill of Rights. We're allowed to do that. 
Seattle is awesome amazing, Portlamd not so much. The land of don't pump ur own gas gimme a fucking break
Yeah, so playing a game is addictive but ingesting a substance isn't.great logic.
It's fake. It's police vs. police. Just an exercise. There is no televised political context here citizen. Please move on to your regularly scheduled program. 
&gt; This guy is absolutely hilarious.So it's just this video that's not funny? 
Good thing the cameraman was white or else he would have been shot dead within about 14 seconds
Even if pedophilia isn't a choice, it still can't be allowed. You don't get to harm innocent children. 
Every time I log into Duolingo, I ended up getting distracted by videos of dumbass cats. Every time. 
Even if you're aware of the convention and ignore it?
That's because 18 is when you're required to sign up for the draft process shit, and you might be forced to die for your country. So, they let you buy guns, if you can die in our war you can have a gun. But drugs are bad Mmmm'kay.
I'll do anything to avoid work.
Man I wish they still played ska

To be fair, it serves them right for having one of those carpet toilet seat covers. They were not a good interior design choice.
I pray to the Yuri gods that this anime gets some girl-on-girl ~~hot sex~~ lewd hand holding.

The "just close enough to be recognized yet just ambiguous enough to avoid copyright infringement"
If religion causes people to behave this way, then why doesn't this happen more often? More likely, the dude was crazy. 
Sad thing is, this is the future. A lot of jobs are going to get replaced with computers and robots. 
I'm not sure how serious you are, but if so feel free to contact me. If be happy to chat via phone or pm. If you have a game system we could play some games.

As opposed to whatever the next man in line "heard" or "saw"? Give me a break. Do you not believe the Mike Brown investigation/grand jury hearings either? 
&gt;Innocent until proven guiltyThis only applies to the court ruling and has literally no relation to public opinion. Definitions are more important that your emotional response to someone's post on reddit.
If the U.S. could find a way to charge people for being gay it would have been legal years ago.
Looks like it could be a huge beard move, to me. 
Hitchcock. Ophuls. Kubrick. Kurosawa. Tarkovsky. Bunuel. Powell/Pressburger. Tati. Cocteau. Welles. Lang.Did I already say Hitchcock?

You can believe whatever y.ou want.  What you can't do is impose your Christian morality on the rest of us.
Interesting point, saying you vote UKIP or Tory is akin to committing suicide. You'll be shouted down in public wherever you go. 
Guillotines aren't allowed in boxing. Boxing is about standing and punching. I don't see anything wrong with it. I DO see something wrong with the guys who constantly hug each other though.
Stupid and sensitive, I can agree with that.
It's surprising how hard it is for people to understand this.yet they just go and attack the victim. 
Business as usual. Lefties throw their usual tantrums - because emotional restraint or stability is not something an atypical family unit is capable of teaching - and then we get on with things until the next election.
I don't know if this is the right place to bring this up but...If we're going to ban inhumane fox hunting, shouldn't people also be losing their shit over Halal slaughtering...Edit: Instant downvote. Interesting
... And if the conversation was 'Does anyone think Hitler is the savior' that'd be a good search to start with. What's your point?
can we get a possible mirror link so we can see what the original video was?
I do those, but sporadically. what I'm looking for is a hobby that I can improve myself on rather than just a fitness routine. And OK, I will

the fuck was he even doing he just collapased perfectly on the spot
Yeah but Bent has that English premium attached to him.
I just noticed that Fellaini has a similar facial bone structure as a woman whose number I pulled yesterday.
TIL that Carey Price, Tuukka Rask, Ben Bishop, and Jonathan Quick were all apart of the 2005 draft class. 
Topics like this really need the context. I've been drawn in
Good to see him sticking around
Agreed with all of this bar the last, she had a perfectly legitimate reason to snoop.
That she invalidates your reaction is the concerning part.
You know what? Being utterly honest in a relationship is not always a bad thing.Just tell him you have a surprise, and could he please not guess it because it's special for you to him.I hope you two have a happy life, it seems so.
&gt;I'm unfortunately the hypocritical type. I'd fuck any attractive woman I could - meanwhile, if my GF cheated on me, it'd be over in an instant. That's how my brain works and I can't really do anything about it.Why would they trust you?
She's fucking you around. So many red flags. She can't even be honest. You two have a child man. The kid deserves better, and so do you
Talk to her about it. Say that it's been on your mind and you've been trying to ignore it but you can't any more and you need to talk about what she said. Go from there.If she actually is a racist, stop dating her.
thats a good question considering there is no down vote button in /r/relationships.  my guess is a down vote bot has me and the down vote isn't disabled in the api.
Thanks, I already know what you think
totally a real thing that happened, not a fakepost by a bored /r/tumblrinaction poster
Unless you and your father are very close and share a very morbid sense of humor, what he said was totally fucked up and out of line. 
Why are you putting any weight on your sister's moral judgement? She made you complicit in her cheating and could have fucked with your employment.
As a bit of a pizza snob, Dominos is definitely the best commercial pizza out there. They have great service, quick delivery and the quality of their pies has definitely gone up over the years.
Its easy to be involved with the down and out when you can leave them at the end of the day.
You're right. I just looked it up. Purely from his own health's standpoint, that cannot be a good idea. At all.
&gt;  I'm surprised he slid so far downWhen teams reach for guys like Armstead the rich get richer.
Thats funny, the only people who are really trying hard to keep this "argument" up are AFC East fans.
Brady's agent did him no favors today by going full Tinfoil and accusing the league of being rigged.  
Lol Dr. Farsolinos, you created another throwaway account again?
I really wanna see his post-game interview. He greeted the Clippers with class after the game though. 
That sounds like an intro to some MOBA game.
i haven't been there in a long time...but if the davka forums are still up, then they are a great place to download decent quality 80's games 
MVP?Maybe Chef Curry ran out of ingredients.
As in, nope, he didn't regress on defense haha my bad 
than Shawn Kemp best NBA player of all time
If Austin Rivers goes off for 30 points and the Clippers win, I will add a related tag about Austin Rivers to every post I write.
Go hide under a rock until the next season starts, please. Y'all got swept by the lower seed.. Nobody cares if you don't give a fuck, but everyone else does. Obviously you're not gonna give a fuck about anything, you're out of the playoffs. 
Idk about all time but in the last 10-15 years, it's probably the 06 Heat and that's no knock on them.
Am I the only one who thinks she should keep her hair like this? She looks smoking. 
yes that is definitely a worry for all of us on the internet looking at her pictures. thank you. 
We're far from stacked. Neal and Jones are question marks. Peppers is like 36 and plays linebacker. Daniels is good. 
Or at least the square root of the number of days the average sentence holds.
They might also see their shadow and think it's a person, so don't shine flashlights at them 
With my 99 ASVAB I should at least be able to enlist as french fries.EDIT: that's right my Yung butthurt padawans, that's at least 140 in every category that's *one, four oh*
Ok, in an interview, I get that, but I see it most when they're walking around with their SLR rig and an on-cam external mic. That seems pretty superfluous.
Yeah, that was on purpose. I'm not interested in arguing with you, you slobbering horny fanboy.
It's simply hilarious that you answered this question, but not the top voted comments. 
&gt; The school is in it for the money and they are actively lobbying against free education.You seem surprised. 
Yeah, so do I. Funny how we fall on opposite sides of reality, even though we believe in the same three things.
Miller has confirmed they are moving forward with the first sequel.So that is good news.
Nah, fuck this. Date someone who respects you. DTMFA.
Pretty good post. Pisses me off as a guy too, to listen to women complain about clingy guys and horrible dates. "I can't get rid of this guy...!" "Did you tell him you don't want to see him anymore?" "No, why?"
amok sounds like elevator music.tmb sounded fresh and new.
I guess this is somehow, in some way, the Democrats' fault according to the right wing trolls. They can't shut up even when their views are completely irrelevant
He's the poor man's Roger -- indulgent and entitled, but without the charisma that makes up for it. 
how do I plead not guilty after admitting the crime to the police? shouldnt I just hope for a good plea?
A week ago this pic may have set off a craving but today, it set off nausea. So that's a thing.  
keep telling yourself that. Whatever helps you feel better :)
He smokes? Immediately the coolest league player I've ever seen. Is smoking big in Korea?
Can confirm: was a fan, am tired of his shit.
I wish they could stop doing this Lady Gaga type shit. Fashion shows, theatrical entrances, "cute" moments, girly "music" and the scripted trash talk. It's hard to watch and it's fake as fuck. 
Yeah it's shitty, but it's equally dumb that people still go to see him after all these years of him fucking around. 
holy hell what's wrong with you people
unless sansa has some dragon eggs stashed somewhere I don't think the comparison is going anywhere.

This is incredible. I hate that the NFL makes money off of it, but man does that show devotion to Brady or what? When he is supposed to be at his least popular, he's actually more popular than ever.

you all tell me to do that like it's an ideal solution. I can't play meepo with the same settings I play dazzle or chen, we should be allowed to have different settings profiles for specific heroes.

After I pay my last bill I'm going to have my bank account put a stop payment for anything from Comcast. One step ahead of those fuckers.
I love how NC is just always slightly bewildered at everything. Damn, this was great. I can't believe Harris doesn't realize (or maybe he does?) how awful he looks here. 
i think about when spike tried to lift the troll hammer and then told buffy its too heavy and she picked it up just fine
Cause RoF is just basically one big training session for Vegeta and Goku. 
At one point he literally says "and I, Dandelion" during the narration. It's not Vesemir.

Except that he did it in the first place.That's like if your wife fucked your best friend and apologized for it. Nothing to hold against her because she apologized, right?
If it wasn't for iMessage i would be on android.
Bullying the working class? What, by getting 2 million more people working, lowering taxes, and increasing the investment and growth in the economy?
NXT will most certainly be represented, and will probably play a much larger role in this game, simply for the fact that the last game was obviously rushed.
What? It plays movies and doesn't skip. Am I doing it right guys?
Sure, by exploiting and selling women they are honorable.
did you not read what he said? SMALL PROFIT MARGIN, MEANING THERE OVERHEAD IS HIGHER. so sure they seem to make a lot, but they also have to put a lot back into it.
Anyone who judges a real fight by ANYTHING they've ever seen in a Rocky movie doesn't know shit about boxing.
This is the thing people on Reddit don't seem to get, when we talk about banning Hate Speech on Reddit. Hell, they started a whole subreddit about it: /r/subredditcancer
The Bernie Sanders shilling on reddit is going to new heights.
the fact people look forward to operations..that sad life though
Did anyone read the actual post after eating the popcorn?  That person's insane.
That's a remarkably friendly chain of top comments for a subreddit called "fat people hate."Are they usually that supportive?*goes and reads more.*Ah. No. Got it.
Well, when the person I'm fuckin replying to literally brought up professional, clinical psychologists and stated they don't use those terms, I think it's fair to ask for proof, you ill-nurtured weasel. 
Well open your eyes, people link to other places all the time, it's called convenience.
 My comment is still up there sweetie.
Bitch is cinched for the Gods...werk!
Yeah, they should have added a noun after trans. But don't assume they are a trans woman. I don't identity as a trans woman, but I still am going on hrt and want to look feminine. 
For those who don't get it, tradition says when a woman catches the bouquet at a wedding, it is said that she is next to get married.

LPT: you can use the doors at a cheap hotel to practice your door breaking technique! 
Just curious, do you really get some pleasure out of that? I mean making people think you are dumber than you really are. In internet you can be anything you want to be, and you decided to be an idiot.
I side with the liberal consensus on most issues but Iran is absolutely right here. People who do acid attacks should get the death penalty. 
Eh, she needed the Lazarus Pit. Not to mention Ra's specifically mentioned Oliver *not* needing to use his waters to survive was a reason he pursued him so aggressively.

I love Lapis as the asshole teenage stepchild of the Crystal Gems. I hope one day she will be free to troll bird mom to her heart's content. 
This is without exaggeration the worst thing I've ever seen on this sub.
Some say Albert Einstein is still looking for his wallet to this day. 
Absolutely. They're also quite a bit more aggressive - especially in the HoW missions themselves, following you up pathways and hallways they don't in regular missions. 
And by then, PS4 will have had 2 more DLC's where they get exclusive stuff. :(
Idk what's happening, but I'm seeing more black women on reddit these days, and I'm loving it.  Bring some friends, we're so unrepresented, and so sexy.lol
You have to love campus cops. They do the damndest things. Congrats on this! Empowerment without victimology rocks!I love that you brought them food. That is something I would do.

Wait, am I reading that last bit right?&gt;Diabetes type 2 can be treated with *diet and exercise*, and medication. Did... did she just actually admit that what you eat has *gasp* an effect on health issues?
I figured... I guess everyone just needs to beware it's unverified.
That does make sense. Not to mention it is extremely dangerous to be intimate with something that is over 300 lbs. There are people out there who got crushed to death by their morbid obese partners. Most humiliating way to go. 
Some airlines do, but it should be all airlines. Another thing is fatasses shouldn't be allowed to sit in an exit row. They obviously couldn't handle any of the duties associated with it. Plus they might get stuck.
Hahaha "my hour glass figure has a few extra minutes". More like fucking years, because fat ages you!
You actually are. Face is fat. What I see from your upper body is fat. You are fat. Trust me on that. I will bet my life you are a fat piece of shit...and you have that "crazy lady" make up going.

Meh, Russia has nearly a thousand generals. 
And good on him, I say. He's leaving it as he got it. Men who mess about with their eyebrows have got too much time on their hands and that time would be better spent making fire, chopping wood, drinking beer and fighting bears.

Good god this game has jumped the shark.
What about Crash of the Titans?
If you disarmed both sides the only thing that would change is that it would be the Palestinians killing the Israelis since their Arab hommies would quickly arm them and help them out.
fuck... I just realized we are going to have nuclear WWIII during my lifetime. 
When they do I will happily condemn them. Nuclear proliferation in the MENA will be very very bad. I think that Iran is dedicated enough to try "losing" a nuke, especially since the KSA is seeking nukes now too. 
You realise this is propaganda developed by  the same people  who committed a genocide.  Killing people on the basis of statistical projections is dubious, ignoring that there may have been m other possible ways to end the war is ignorance
American hegemony stinks.But it is better than Chinese or Russian Hegemony. I for one welcome us as our new world overlords.

I was more confused about the box of gay porn I found.
Now just put yourself in the shoes of someone being called retarded by you and you can see the answer to your own question. 
Don't bother. I'm already coming for you.
Unsure if you meant tidal waves...
Sports have been around longer and have ingrained themselves in our species
Yeah. If it's anything, it should be that white people are the worst.
Its a good weekend with a lot of friends and well wishers:D
Oh, right. I never really learned which one was which, though I played way too much of their SNES game.
That /r/askwomen /r/twoxchromosomes and /r/relationships are the most toxic, man-hating of the popular subreddits.
Sure, I'll confess to a felony.
Most guys do, and it is encouraged. You're really just using anecdotes and confirmation bias to mask quite a few opinions expressed here on reddit. 
Exactly. The rich make the rules and don't have to follow them.
Go back to the 00s with your gif. This is 2015.
I can't help but wonder how many anime you've rated lowly or hated on because you just *assumed* there isn't a 2nd season..
If the GIF guys were French, sure. JIF. Whatever.However, they only went with it because thought it would be cute to pronounce it like that particular brand of peanut butter.Fuck them. That's stupid.
Liberals only care when it's white on black.  They totally ignore the black on white crime epidemic, knockout games Rapes etc.
Which isn't even "high caliber" enough to be legal to hunt deer.
Go read The new Jim Crow, it's a great book. Long story short, most of our laws are repressive bullshit with no value whatsoever. This country is fucked and the closer you look the more fucked it gets.
I actually upvoted your original comment and was surprised to see your edit saying you're being downvoted (score is still hidden)
For a budget of $150 million and only $40 million worldwide, it doesn't seem so promising. For a film to be a success, it has to almost double its budget in profits. 
Calm words is not civility. Only an idiot would confuse the two. Under a "calm reply" is necessary implications of incivility and hatred by the very nature of his claimed status as a racist. Only a child would be unable to differentiate between the two.
This doesnt matter because it, like the Javelin missile, is designed to tear through the much lighter top armor.
Cop was profiling you.   Probably expected you to be drunk or high.
What do those quotes mean? Is there some way in which a Reddit man is called a man but is not actually a man?
5 year old are definitely old enough to say if they want to allow someone to cut part of the genitals off for no medical reason. Absolutely. Have you met a 5 year old? 
my boss did. i was conveniently told that we didn't have enough money to pay employees. so i went without a paycheck when i worked for Ron Paul. It was a "passion project". Fuck that.
Yep, Richmond BC is all white and has one Chinese family.  Surrey used to have an East Indian, but he moved.Ottawa is all white and Inuit.
Our points here aren't contradictory. Police have new tools, crims have new tools too :) 
je ne vais rien faire puisque de toute façon les gens comme toi rasent les murs et se font tout petit dehors, pourquoi me prendre la tête avec quelqu'un d'aussi pathétique que toi ? qui n'a meme pas le courage de poster avec son vrai compte !! :)
And all you bitches in this sub? Whaaaaa no one caters to me. Bunch of fucking spoiled babies you all are.
Have fun supporting the deadbeat.
Yes, you are definitely spending way too much time on this =)
it's not a burden at all, it's less of a burden now than it's ever been.
You know he's talking about 2005-2007, right? Not 1998. You're like some guy who got broadband late and thought it wasn't around until YouTube came out. Cheap LCD screens were a thing for two years by the time vanilla WoW was hitting T3.
ISKCON being a bonafide tradition is laughable. Speculation is mentioned in sruti (manyante), and the quote of Vivekananda mentioned nowhere says what Prabhpada rants about. He can't even stay on topic.
She feels more secure in the relationship and thus doesn't feel the need to have sex as often/she's too tired to have sex/she's not as attracted to you as she used to be.Try having sex in the morning.
What about if she was 18? Would the response have been completely different? I absolutely relate to her.
Do you have any links? I haven't seen any particularly useful threads there.
Your comments on being the best by all measures is subjective. Alabama osu and fsu have all had very similar resumes.
honestly imma try it more to see if its true. this could actually be a big thing if it is
The only thing worse than commercials is the anti-commercial circle-jerk. It wouldn't be bad if it was a few times, but every fucking commercial there are 10 comments 'derrr DAE hate commercials?' People just trying to get cheap upvotes
No you're being downvoted because you're being an asshole.
This was a bigger tease than "Surf"
Neither will be upgrade to what we have.

My main concern is getting a decent place to stay I'll have approximately $1100.00 a month to work with now that I'm more stable and i want to do the best I can my employer gives me legal help as one of my benefits any idea how I could leverage that?
What she was making doesn't matter. Ask for the standard wage in that position or higher.  If she is underpaid she can find a new gig paying more.  That is McDonald's money.
The relationship a teacher has to a student in a classroom is very different from a scout leader with a boy on week-long camping trips in the wilderness. The former leaves relatively little room for them to be alone.
I see someone was a big fan of the Watchtower of Turkey video 
So you'd rather have Cruz, who wants to go to war with Russia, or Rubio who wants to go to war with Iran?  I'm not saying the options are awesome, I'm saying these are definitely different approaches to the use of the military.
Ok, so it seems like it has to do with his state of mind when he changes. If he's angry and changes uncontrollably, that's what the hulk will be. If he's calm and changes under his own control, he'll be like that.
Cap would keep telling him to watch his language...
Overcast is one app that I can't update because it's for iOS 8.3 :P
yeah the name "jailbreaking" doesn't help. Also, it was illegal for a long time until recently with the exemptions.
LOOOOOOOOOL I thought someone would say that :P
Yes you do!! Sorry I forgot to mention that. Backup your device with iTunes before doing this if you want to keep important data :)
okay well good luck. Just know that I think some people will get pissed and call it repetitive (alot of people rant about stock iOS when there isn't a jailbreak) ;)
yeah this guy is definitely just a troll looking for attention. I hope the mods delete this post.
yeah it isn't the best way but as long as you get it from well known piracy repos, you should be okay. Besides, if it is paid, you aren't pirating anything since you paid for it originally and own it.

Very hazel :) don't ever feel down about your looks you are gorgeous!
I posted that this would happen in that thread and got downvoted. Pretty upsetting.
When one person's misplay causes another person to mess up, I don't really consider person 2 misplaying.I do agree with your points of Bard ult'ing way too late though.
Americans sucking at videogames is nothing new.These people will always go on to blame population and servers just like they do in CSGO. But when a country that has less opportunities ends up wrecking US, then what?

Please tell me his kids are fit and strong and him and his wife are, too.
No, this is the real world, and I live in it. You're a troll for existing in our world. Go back under your rock. 
I just thought it was very strange that you went for "Non-American" instead of "Non-English" since all the swear words you count as "American" are English words.
I just hope it affects AOS and does not feature in the Netflix shows but I guess we have to wait for the movie.
Yes. As long as you haven't had a discussion about being exclusive, you're good to go. 
I'd hold that right above your clit while I fondle your tits and suck on them
Too much theory bullshit in this thread. The real reason is because pros aren't afraid to waste all their gold on sentries, dust, etc. and this ruins Riki's laning phase. Riki actually needs farm to be effective.
Why no one gets Aquila on tiny?

To add to this : The WiiU is much much much more similar to the Xbox One and PS4 than the Wii was to the PS3/Xbox 360, so Nintendo is moving in the right direction when it comes to these kinds of things.

good thing u dont work for valve
I did this and it didn't remove them. I know I saved the ini properly because other changes I made to it did work. 
It's funny how many conflicting reactions my comments here got.  Someone else replied that, as a Texan, it warmed their heart to hear I think of Texas as Texas instead of the south.  Guess there really isn't a way to please everybody :)
Well its closest competition is either Father and Son due to status staves (especially since they can hit any unit with a res lower then 20) or Chap 19 since it's just so long and spams so many promoted enemies at you which are decently tough.
Please don't spread bad information.

That is exactly why we need advertisers, so they can make a pitch to the developers.
Why would you be ever shoulder charging in PvE?! What kind of Titan are you?!
&gt;We play for fun, for the excitement, the literal adrenaline rush of actually testing our skill, our strategies and our communication in a game mode where every decision matters.Hell yes, I could not agree more.
When you say in a row do you mean literally in a row? Because typically when you lose a game or two it probably makes sense to take a break.
Lol...Legacy mode is great for skilling but is lacking behind for the Damage / PvM aspect. You can still play it if you want but higher level things will suffer.
Yesssss!That means the pitchforks and torches I bought won't go to waste!
Ooooooooooh; you're a career troll, I get it, boo boo! &lt;3 xox
Geert Wilders and people who follow Pam Geller aren't exactly "good" although I suppose I can see why someone like you would think as much.
No, fun is appreciated. Please bring some.
Same here man. Goodluck on your next post
Just look at Japan. You'll answer your own question 
Couldn't decide whether to bet nV and hope for a miracle or go with olofmeister, and after GFNS threw away their game against PiTER I'm hesitant on betting on underdogs.
Says who? And no, they shifted like 2%.
No, they're not skewed. eLevate is one of the best teams in NA. The chance of Paradox winning 2-0 against eLevate is  probably around 9%.
NA need to work on their CT*. God they all suck so fucking hard on CT its insane.
i got downvoted too for predicting exactly what happens now.someone tried to sway i think.
I know they're pretty T sided but d2 CT really isn't that hard.
This literally makes my dick shrivel. 
That is something i have no problem with i just hope they don't use it as a way to change superhero origins.
rare? i play on a server which is at eu primetime High pop.. and there are Airdrops every few minutes!! while i writing this.. the airplaine is still red like the most time and says all planes are busy.. and i can hear them most time 
Yea, I mean not in store. They might have them

No, I'm not interested in hurting the rich.  I'm just not interested in my tax money subsidizing bad practices from businesses, and not paying a living wage is a bad practice.

nah that's not right, my roommate just broke his thumb the other day being a drunk ass, they threw a cast on him. theres no way you broke your thumb 2-3 times year and continued to play effectively. absolutely no way

Well, you might as well build the rest of the moat.
You:  What a cute deer!Deer:  I want to suck your blood!You:  ...
&gt; but the game itself requires much more equipment. Like what? 2-3 coke bottles to serve as bases? That's what I used as a kid, worked quite well.
It is totally irrelevant, compared to the illustriousness of the UK. Just because Ecuador gets it wrong, doesn't mean the UK should continue to, also.
Probably not true. Like all North Korean news. Is he even made aware everytime someone defects? 
They should build a distributed network.  Or at least a site that you can go to find the current pirate bay url.  The MPAA won't be winning this one.
Long term contraception, temporary sterilization what's the difference. Its obvious and very clear they didn't mean permanent sterilization. Not everyone speaks English as a first language. 
Men who survive Ebola should use condoms if they have sex and take care when disposing of the condoms.
Other than money already being insured, wouldn't this give incentive to choose a bank that has a clean record?
Depends on your definition of race, I guess.
Wait... why can't the kurds get involved with this? They CERTAINLY have the will to fight!

Well, the massive amphetamine addiction brought about by the ADHD craze will have to be dealt with.
Musicals.  I'm obsessed with musicals.  To top it all off I've recently discovered Legally Blond the Musical and it's amazing.  It's kinda funny because I'm probably the most butch or "manliest" dude in my group of friends.
I can't get through and will not forever.Life is so.But I have a solution .That is have an hour to listen to "symphony no.9" of Beethoven."Through the all difficulties out to your victory." I believe this messege of the song is truth .

Mythical creatures like you enjoy hearing those sorts of things from time to time.

Buy one house and pay 20k towards it every day for a few weeks.  Buy another house.  Depending on the total cost of the house you would be closing once every 2 to 5 weeks.

I haven't kept any friends from childhood due to moving and just changing. I have also cut off friendships with people from high school due to how immature they still are and incapable of developing their own ideas, opinions, and beliefs.

So if I understand this correctly, they were taking what is basically the same thing as what goes into Bagpiper and Officer's Choice and those brands (not Amrut) and poured it into empties of Chivas and JW and what not?
Chatted with him for a while a few years back. Super nice guy.
I've watched tens of F/SN amvs since it aired. I never said your amv is bad, I'm saying that if you want more viewers/popularity on this sub then you're going to have to do something different. The formula you used is stale and everyone here hates it.
I dunno, but it seems like whenever a live action is announced everyone says it lowers the chances of that anime getting another season. At least for Chihayafuru.
Yes. But are you really sure you want to see them? I would reconsider if I were you.
Well hopefully it gets animated soon. I'm interested in seeing what it has to offer.
I don't know if this counts as self promotion, but I will beat any rate you get offered.
