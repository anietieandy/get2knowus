Met a group of girls in Vegas one time with some buddies of mine. One of them introduced herself and said, "My name's Jessica, but my friends call me TurboWhore."So that was nice.
That's a shame, because the trailers made it look very over-the-top wacky and it was an instant turnoff to me.
It's a valid choice as a favourite author. There are guidelines as to style and formula so there is consistency across the books, so there is no real reason why you couldn't have them as a choice.

I think that is on the receipt so the person finishing the order knows not to just yell a name, but to go notify the person instead.
I would agree that the OP is rigid, but more due to her replies than the OP.
Just keep running with the group until someone else falls in a more embarrassing manner. 
No.  It would not decrease your credit score.  Your utilization rate, might however.

He nuked Condia's too. Trounced him in a $1 H2H.
&gt; Yeah. I later found out from someone else she was really religious and a total prude, so she was probably turned on by my raw animal sexuality which freaked her out. That's what I liked telling myself, anyway.
you can't tell me these people don't have an iphone.  
You're right there, man. Most of that scene is instant buy for me, Masters of Reality, Alain Johannes etc are all covered by my instant buy policy.

I remember my third grade teacher having the Narnia series in her classroom library. WTF was your teacher on about?
The version we read when I was in gr 8 (12/13 years old) wasn't edited! Led to some interesting class discussions.
My two university graduations, particularly the second. The year leading up to it was the toughest year of my life to date and completing it was a big f-you to a lot of awful, vindictive teachers I've encountered through my life.

That's why I said shooting it properly. The free bit I understand though.
I'm just curious about your perspective.Yes I do think you should feel guilty because I think that's how I would feel, and obviously everyone thinks their own moral stance is correct.Thanks for answering!
I mean I definitely understand what you're saying, and I think you have a lot of merit (and you've convinced me).  I was just wondering if it's applicable to the OP.  But thanks for the thought provoking discussion :)
Haha thanks for being able to empathise, I feel better knowing that I'm not the only one at least! 
Seahawks and I stuck with it. I saw the helmet on the back of a cereal box in Italy promoting the movie Little Giants. Moved to the states in 97 and Seattle was the closest team anyway.

I freaking murder him. I spent many years training in boxing and kickboxing as part of my MMA training, plenty to slide past 1/2 speed punches and put Floyd on the ground. At that point his speed doesn't matter.
32 weeks and I've gained 30 pounds. early on they told me to try to stay between 25-35 so it looks like I will go over that :( they haven't said anything to me yet but I'm waiting for it now that I go in every other week. 
I was told early on that I have an anterior placenta too. I wonder if that's whats happening with him. I really would like to avoid a c-section if possible :(
Uhh yeah, I'm officially 60 days out and can hardly believe it
I had never dry heaved until I was pregnant.  Man, the ab workouts I get in the staff washroom between classes nowadays....!  My abs are more sore from dry heaving than from when I was doing bootcamp!
Finally someone gets it. I just hate it when kids actually get molested, they tell Mom that their uncle or whoever touched them, but Mom doesn't want to get her brother in trouble.

Oh yeah,  I have no doubt they make fun of me quite a bit.  They're teenagers,  after all,  that's how they define their realities; by making fun of things.  Being a teenager sucks,  I do not envy them at all.  
I can tell by his logic and how he communicates that he's a kid.  Some kid who used dad's credit card and is now trying to make excuses.

Wow.  There's what passes for intelligent debate on /r/Canada. Don't forget to cry extra hard this time when Harper wins, again. Because mark my words, he likely will, for the reasons I have articulated.

Mellisandre.Maybe it's just the writing, but she comes off like a whiny spoiled teenage girl when she begs guys for sex.  She's not seductive or mysterious, she just raises her eyebrows, her pitch/tone of voice, and pouts.
She talks about how frightened she is of him in some scene, then the very next is as bitchy as she can possibly be.  Even after seeing what Theon has become.D&amp;D have made show Sansa into a dumb girl.

That very last throw, third in a row, was gutty as hell. Awesome demonstration of how the rules shape the training, drilling to repeatedly expose your opponent's back while also generating amplitude in a series of movements from the same grip.

Do it when you're near/on the way to Queenstown. Queenstown itself is a busy (by NZ standards) tourist area, but the surrounding area is nowheresvile, especially west or southwards towards Invercargill.
Holy crap!!! Our lowest quote for home owners was 1040, but it would mean bundling for a more expensive auto insurance policy 
Save your energy, Nick! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CObJZf2YzDw
Lets do this. How can we get in contact with an organizer in Vietnam?
People seem to forget the 1993 WTC bombing for some reason. It pretty massive news at the time, and the talk was often about whether there would be more attacks.
Always good to have some bonds.  Also, unless you get a Total World stock market, you'll be heavily concentrated in one country (US) or internationally.
This might just be my jaded outlook but I did not think the cat was spelling FUN in chocolate.  I agree with /u/tccomentate, this was a big thing when I was in 5th/6th grade.  And /u/MaxPaynesRxDrugPlan it the nail on the head.
A suggestion: You've got the bots for "looks like you're asking about a plant" or "a bug" or whatever... How about one that detects the words "worth" or "value" and directs people to /r/whatsthisworth?
I would like to say warsword but it doesn't have enough polish for me. Anno domini or perisno. I don't like perisno's world too much but it's a fairly complete mod
Hugs.  I hate this part of transition - the sterilization.   
Could it be from [this **Galaxy Quest** clip](http://youtu.be/hthl28SEGfk)?
Due for a strikeout maybe.God you're stupid!
He's a giant steaming pile of douche. Ask bar owners in downtown Springfield what they think of Miller.
Do I need to have mlb.tv *premium* to hear the Dodgers broadcast? I like Jon Miller but he's rooting for the other guys. It pretends like it's going to switch but then it goes back to the local broadcast
IT WAS ME JUSTIN! I TURNED IT DOWN!!
What I would give for a surprise double chapter of epic fight scenes...
Taxing corporations is just a round about way of increasing the GST. Why not just cut to the chase and do that?
They don't have to sell them there, they extract from there and sell them to economies in which people get payed enough to buy. 
Very nice case, love the hinged door. I'm quite taken by the Thermaltake Core V51 and the Carbide 540, very tempted to upgrade from my Spec03
I looked back at the past few months and it looks like a trend!
My name wasn't even on the database :/ super Sicilian names aren't included I guess. 
That was fucking awesome. Although I was expecting the heat to destroy the ceramic.
Mine's ~~down.~~ back up now. I wouldn't be surprised, though.
is there any chance I could get a fit pic?
I think it will be a good while until I can take that one! This would/will be my first toy...
I can play hearthstone, but hots needs too much focus and much time...
Wow Skittles you're... *stunning.*
To hop on a plane, show up at your guy's doorsteps and party.
Don't feel bad. I didn't get mine until 26.
I loves a woman with determination!  :)
I'm surprised that my Sonic amiibo didn't give a Mario game &lt;_&lt;
Yeah! Sorta weird to see hate toward reformed fatties there too. Especially if we grew up fat. I know HAES and fatlogic folks hate us the most (so its mutual!) because we prove what they say wrong :p
Please let it be $300 in pennies
Mixture of corn starch and water. It's a solid and a liquid at the same time
I don't enjoy the role playing game we are playing that he created. :(
For whom the bell tolls. Sounds incredibly epic. 
&gt; there are still several newspapers that have excellent articles, observations and analysis of the newsDon't they usually have the same material online, though? That said, I'm not slagging off newspapers. I quite like them!
Ayatsuri mugendan songs are really hard to pull off,  same with critcrista I wonder how will they pull those off. 
As a pregnant woman, this thread is a big old relief. I Kegel like crazy (have for years before kids were an option) and reading practically every comment refuting the "loose after childbirth" stereotype is amazing. 
I'd wait and try again in a year or so. 
People are just shitty sometimes.  Hopefully you'll have some good karma coming your way.
Public Administration? Talk to the career counselors at your college. Also, community colleges often have a lot of the bullshit classes online, if you're automotivated enough to do the work. 
74% alliance, 69% UUP and 63% SDLP. No surprises
You might want to ask a tax professional. I thought it was square footage. 
What technology do we have that can make undeveloped (not under developed) lungs develop?
Go out with him. Grad school people are looking for love too. And you're not in the class anymore
This is the end. I always said this show would never last.
I WENT OFF on a friend who said this to me once talking about my relationship. We're no longer friends.
Thank you for this. I'm going to make this tomorrow.
Marlon Byrd! I like Sandy. And I actually liked Omar more than everyone else here. I think the free agent signings are mostly due to the pursestrings being tight, but yeah, Sandy's gotta pick it up with the major league acquisitions. 
This. I took both writing 2 and writing 50 (I didn't have to do 1) over summer sessions. A lot easier. Most have a final essay that you have to write, and they both had shorter requirements for me since I did summer sessions. 
Nice! It really is a small world, if you see us on the flight say hi! Tiny brown haired lady and a tall blonde guy buzzing off their face that it's DW time!
hnnnnngggg, do want, add destructable lights and noise levels for ranged weapons and you got yourself some stuff I want. 
If I could do it all over again I would have learned to code. 
Oh, man. That sounds... intense. Not gonna lie though, I'd love to see feet and hands coming through my belly skin! Have you found that your chill baby was chill in the womb, too?
We stopped after 4 and I don't regret it. They've all turned out great. 
You may be right, but I'm afraid some people might read this as "It's ok to have unprotected sex with someone if I'm HIV+ as long as I take my meds."
It's true. I have 4 children. Hurt like nothing else, but was oh so worth it.
Heaven's Feel will happen in the upcoming movies. They won't fully spoil the truth behind the grail in UBW. 
No, but we're really not interested in his political opinions, are we?
In a topic as divisive as abortion, I think medical accuracy is the most objective approach. 
I hope they leverage his assassination to catalyze that.  I feel it's a huge piece of the book.
&gt; I cheer for the Dodgers... who do you cheer for, individual players?Literally you one minute ago.
Me too :( Heck, my coworker even had a dream I was pregnant and she doesn't even know I'm TTC!
Also, there was a box with a few others, maybe a whole copy of "Les Miserables," and a bunch of empty film reels.Now if only I had a movie-theater-sized projector.
Us humans don't do anything until it is too late. It's how we roll. Mark my words, there will be major unrest and conflict before anything like Basic Income becomes reality.
Can you collaborate on consequences with other teachers? Maybe a weekly detention with rotating supervision?
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
What's up with Beckham churning the butter?
This guy has nerves of balls and steel of the heavens. Holy shit. 
Every tennis player has had such moments of poor behavior and if you think your fave hasn't, you're fooling yourself. This boils down to whether you like Serena or not.As for the voting around here, it's asinine and I don't participate in it.
No, it isn't, who is telling you these things? 
Twas my senior year of college and probably the best year of my life
We can have an impact, but someone telling me that 64 million pounds of something got dumped in it doesn't tell me that it does have an impact.Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't, but just hearing a number doesn't tell me anything.
Because those sad little eyes.Were In the Ghettooooooooooooo....
You could probably get away with black jeans if you go to a small ward in rural northern Utah.  But, you have to wear your cowboy boots with them.
Your right personally I don't because I'm a single guy but if I had kids to take care of it would be a diffrent story. 
Please do. I live in Oklahoma, and I fully acknowledge that Oklahoma sucks in a lot of ways and Texas is great in a lot of ways, but the worst part of living here is listening to Texan transplants tell me how much it sucks.
This is not even a valid statement.  What is he trying to get out of you?  He's not trying to change you.  You're very clearly trying to change him.And, I'm not totally convinced you're not a troll.
not at the expense of Adams progress and development 
Five years is a lot of time to tie down your money for a 2.25% return.  That's my take.
As much as I would like it, I think our slogan "Live. Breath. Longball." is all we need :)...well it could be "It's time for Donger baseball"...
No central air conditioning, but surely you have heat?
No, let's not get this twisted, Alvey is definitely fun to watch in the cage. 
You're 16.Stop fucking and start studying.
I totaly expected something else here...lol  I love your response!  
Not surprising from the Golf Channel
OK that was so wrong I might actually give it a try. 
What's wrong with the term "fetus"? It's a medical term. 
I kind of feel like he was just ignorant and had no social cues to stop himself from asking the question... He wasn't trying to be malicious or creepy
Whew, no one has said my name yet.
Only if you throw in a flux capacitor and a 24 year old Charles Woodson so we can get him a ring.. again  
When Leo discovers his mom and she won't wake up. That's just too much for me.
I don't think it was merely alleged, it sounds like it was confirmed in an investigation.  If a professor sexually harasses online students, removing his classes from the website is an obvious and necessary first step.
But if the goal is to kill the president why would you go after him while he is in the white house, their is a bunch of better opportunities. 
I'm not a fan of people who use drinking to excuse crappy behavior, but in this case we'd both had a bit to drink so it is understandable that she wasn't quite specific enough.
Yeah, there was no reason for him to mention wedge esplicitly. All this info was useful and interesting, but he could've kept it at that, and not included the extra digs.
Huh. "Staff NCO" was something I only ever heard a Marine say.
Fucking imagine Obama just put the hands up and keep a good distance between he and Cruz.
Yes, and I ask if they will hide the update costs in fees, or if they will actually work on security issues.
No, read my post. it clearly does not do that.
I tried to keep is pg 13, we don't want people to wet themselves, don't we? 
Going through my old papers for this year I found it buried in a stack. I'm a teacher. Shit gets lost sometimes. 
Root beer so you don't have to taste that alcoholic crap.
You ruined this woman's life. No way should you even be *around* children, much less create one. My advice to her would be to sue you for everything you've got, based on your repeated assaults. 
They get way more than 2015 passengers, it would have to be in the 10's of thousands per day.
I don't grade homework, personally. I check for completion, go over the material and then hold them accountable on Fridays with a short 5 question fill in the blank quiz focusing on the grammar or vocabulary from the week.
There are plenty of English language learners in English-speaking schools in the US that have little to no grasp of the language. Teachers are supposed to modify content for them but it can be tricky. 
I mean dude had a vision and got shit done, at least he tried something with his life and will forever be remembered in the pages of history.
Disney movies as adult entertainment.  Blech...
... Huh. You're right. Well fuck, there goes my gold star in reading.
Where are these 5ks where 31 minutes gets you in the top 10 finishers?
Name brand! Money is no object to you tonight! 
Can we ban drinking or any kind of alcohol sales? Please?
If its assault on a state employee, employee of the school district or public servant then there is an automatic minimum felony charge. As there should be. 
Aren't Bangladeshis usually Muslim? I mean, wasn't it East Pakistan?
That would be so much better.  I love my boy, but I don't trust him to pick out a ring I'll want to wear every day for the rest of my life.
Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. 
Madeleine L'Engle and Virginia Woolf

Why is it? If someone asks me, I'm not answering because it's none of your fucking business. All YOU need to know is the results of my latest HIV/STD tests.And why would you ask anyways?
Why steam punk falls under the category of comic book conventions. 
I'm going to die. I hope it's quick.
Yes! I'm going to get a rifle too. So if anyone gets too close I can just rack it. No bullets, just empty threats.
Parents cannot be just "friends" with their child(ren).  They must parent their children, hold them accountable, and set forth just punishment for choosing to follow the rules.  I wonder what kind of day "I" had. :)
Driving could be bad if you forget where each light goes. 
My high school boyfriend's cheap cologne. 
"going forward" Are there other fucking options? Do you know something about time travel that I don't? Somehow this phrase bothers me more than "in future" or really any phrase, period. 
I don't think I'd trust the promise of a skilled liar.I would not stick around.
Sometimes. Doesn't mean we go around committing hate crimes
They are an absolute BITCH!!!!!!!! I had them and was talking to a lady who had them when she was pregnant. Passed the stones and said childbirth after going through the stones was NOTHING!
That's a good start! I'm glad you're on the right path.
I won tickets to a cancelled festival once. They still sent me them though and they're still in a drawer for some reason. 
25. It seems like the perfect age. You look like an adult and still have a good body. 
you sound as if you are in a good place. Kudos. It takes work to get there.
Uhum. Isn't this just Batman's song from The Lego Movie?
Article has been vastly modified since yesterday. 
Or, Westminster parliaments, as it were. It's almost as if they are all related somewhat... 
Cool, will rinse them off and give them to cat.
The Sting! my favorite episode of anything, EVER... the twist at the end
it was the 2010 season, which means naturally that the play offs happen in 2011
If you were looking to quote it you have to use standard text email quotes of lines preceded by a &gt;So &gt; "Your quote" looks like:&gt; Your quote
You could report it, like you're supposed to and be on the straight and narrow.
I was going for more acknowledging of weirdness, but understanding that others have interesting lives not like my own.
I'm thinking The Stones' "[You Can't Always Get What You Want](http://youtu.be/7S94ohyErSw)"
Commented to view later. My friend is having weird rubber banding issues after playing for a few minutes. Good specs and no noticeable latency difference between us. 
Incidental or not (personally, that foul was atrocious and certainly not worth arguing about, but I don't think he meant to bump him), the precedent was set last year with Fernandez and should be upheld as per. 4 games. 
I've literally never been contacted by a scammer. I'd never have known that a thing without this sub. 
Maybe, but I'll probably keep the Bifrost for when they do the inevitable USB 3 update. (it's really just how nice the stack looks, damn my vain need for matching audio components)
sometimes you can find the Beyerdynamic Dt 990 for $120 to the states on ebay. might want to see if you can pick those up for home use, otherwise the 598 idea is great for gaming.
Age of Ultron, on the other hand, is a bit more science fiction-y, I think, but still isn't what I'd consider Science Fiction, capitalization and all.
My resilience. I don't make a lot of money, I'm not super attractive. But when I want to do something or be something, I work my ass off to make it happen. I've been through hell and back and I'm still here.
I would love to take acid and wander around there at night by myself.
My clothes rack comes apart into metal bars. And it's a cheap clothes rack, so it wasn't properly sanded down. I honestly think that might do it.
Yum. This is gonna get tried out just as soon as my SC arrives.

It was super windy a few days ago. It's probably just a reaction to that. 
Pretty much, hahaha. Though also trying different kart combinations. 
I'm a teacher, we have state tests called "End of Instruction" or "The EOI"
new arachne is way more fun.... she is unstoppable in 1v1 scenarios 
Are you saying that Christianity says that you're automatically married to anyone you sleep with??
Touch it just to make sure. It could just be 3D illustrating at it's best
I read this as if I just stubbed my toe and wanted to swear
This brings me no joy, I normally get a good laugh from this sub but this is just sad, the fact this was someones mom is painful no one deserves to be raised by this.
I've never actually beater VoG HM. I just loaded in on a friend as Atheon was disintegrating and got a Mythoclast. 
Well, to be fair, those are both VERY recent changes... Like, 3 weeks or less, I think.
They are still the minority and should be shamed for being so. 
You aren't required to wear them during pregnancy. :)
So why did it get you in trouble?
You heard her accent too? Soooo swoonworthy!  
Hey, I'm from Detroit! I'm a teacher. Got the day off. Had family reunion in Texas last year. Holla at me!
I love love love Chromeo! They're funky as all get out!
Yup! Now I'm at a point where a woman could have an awesome body, but if her personality sucks or is not that smart... let's just say I wouldn't want anything long-term with her.
Noooo!!!! She can't break the streak!!!
Just changed the old PSP commercials with the Squirrels and PSP talk with Pikachus and amiibo.
They said there was no gravity weather resist. 
I'd laugh my arse off if she ends up being Aliphese Fateburn VIII reference of all the things. 
Vitos is quite good, but his reflex are khirel tier with less durability, unless you ensure the one shoot or have counter measurements for his low durability and reflex he will be lackluster. 
Depends on your line and in your striker. 
I sense that his Mother's Day gift began with the letter "D".
Actually, it does make sense! They have to make money from the loan somehow.   I wonder if refinancing later would lead to a better interest rate or if it's just better to save up more and cut out the PMI
Is this offer fulfilled? I am flairing fulfilled offers. Thanks!
Have you ever heard the expression "It is too good to be true"?
Had no idea Hiro was coming back, we shall see how that goes
To have a variety of sources and to make sure you know how to use hard copies. It's as much about acquiring the skill as it is about the information. There are too many kids who don't know how to properly locate information from a book.
Haha no no it's an amazing new show called Wayward Pines
One of his runes allow each one of his trust to become A rank Noble Phantasm. Effectively bypassing The requirements of Zerk NP, as stated in the nasuverse it's a tough figth on Lancer end but it actually gives him a fighting chance. 
My parents only allowed it on long road trips... as if some magic (only present on long car rides) was keeping us safe. Uhh... long car rides are no safer than any other drive! 
Oh my. Yeah, I would tell her that she owes you a hundred bucks toward a new chair, and when she doesn't pay, write her off as a friend. Asshole tax. 
Asking a Muslim to bake a cake with Muhammed on it infringes his beliefs directly. Unless you're demanding a homosexual encounter to go with your cake its not the same.
TES.co.uk - I don't know if Americans can get it but most teachers in the UK get their resources from this site.
I wish I could say something to my students, but there is no way that I can.  Stupid cult.
The swoons are the reason I became a teacher.
I'm aware. Just couldn't help myself. 
I'm uber jelly. I have peanut butter. No apples :(
If it's a huge game like that there is almost zero chance of it being sold out, that said rare JRPG's have a pretty high chance of being sold out. 
PvP is why I want it.  Crota can taste the wrath of my ghorn.
Furthermore, if Eddie and iris were really going to commit to their relationship, would reverse flash exist? In rf's timeline, iris was married to Barry. I'm looking into this too much I think. 
Thank you, and yes it is! Before I met my SO I thought I would never fall in love, and now we're getting married. Life is good.
I think I've seen it for around 23. It's regularly around the 25-28usd mark though.
An old roommate of mine who had been a costuming major had a saying for this: "If you can't hide it, feature it!" I can't tell you how many times this has been appropriate in so many aspects of my life.
I don't mean to pile it on, but I also slept with your girlfriend. And I gave her lots of comments during it.
Actually Lancer is one of the few capable of topping Goldie on not so bizarre circumstances. Blame on his master ruining him and EG luck stat. 
Must be nice to be richy rich and afford to fuck up your value with glass. 
None of the above- my bio sister was adopted, and found us 9 years ago. She's my best friend now :) I was the maid of honor in her wedding and her daughter is named after me :) I hope to be an adoptive mom someday
I bet when DJ LeMahieu walks into the clubhouse, he screams "DJ LEMAHIEU IS IN THE BUILDING MAKE SOME NOIIIIIISE!!!" and proceeds to make wub wub sounds.
Careful, folks. Malware on that link.
I'll take that as a compliment then! Thank you!
&gt;**Re-release** &gt;*To make something such as a film or CD available to the public for a second time*Yeah, it wasn't a re-release on PC.
It's part of IDEA part b but it has to be included in her IEP. Also check out http://www.passitoncenter.org. They recycle equipment and provide it to families in need. Rifton.com has a lot of info that is very helpful and easy to understand. 
I thought they've used him before for other foreign non PPV/Fox cards?
Dodgers win 11-1Fuckers still talk about the Stanton home runFuck the media
This is exactly what happened. I'm a teacher. You'd think that sweaters sprouted from the ground.
The pick any European city they want to host, and get to enter again to defend their title.
I love when he touches me hair. He doesn't do it that often because my hair tangles easily. :(
Hudson is a great name! That's my vote. 
I'm only 2 1/2 days post op and I'd say yes you'll definitely need help. I've needed help cleaning, eating and changing so far, plus help with drains, meds etc. I definitely see your dilemma but you're going to probably need a lot of help.
Isn't that illegal though? Driving that slowly on those roads is asking for a collision
Why yes -- a bulletproof vest.-James Rodges, murderer, on his final request before the firing squad 
More social interaction the better. 
These people have some how confused loving a show with being in love with a show, probably due to lacking the skills need to process ones emotions of some stupid shit. 
Interesting thing about these stories. In the US stupid name stories are typically used to mock the stupidity of the poor and uneducated. In Australia the same stories are typically used to mock the vanity of rich, although that is starting to change.
Shoot me... Or Robin. He's the scapegoat 
Yeah, Narset is toxic as hell. I mean, as much as I love sylvan primordial, he should probably stay where he is. Dead eye needs to join him on that list, so does Iona. But id rather just have them not touch the banned list, if anything.
I'd argue that any amount is a scary amount because of the fucked up nature of their beliefs
