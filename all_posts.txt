Good good. I'll return to pounding your momma from behind. 
Two days for a half hours worth of what dad shows you when you're 7?
I do the exact same thing. I love my frickin ergo. Allows me to play videogames while also being a responsible parent... AND I get a workout, because I'm pacing back and forth *while* playing
So you're saying...  there's a chance?
This is just terrible, like the worst response
I'm joking man but yeah lower  your car. And uh depending like if you got coilovers you could just throw the stock suspension back in if you needed warranty work 
Fake guitars go hand in hand with their fake problems
No, he's asking for a super flashy anime series to totally ruin the look and feel of the Witcher.
Oh low call volume is another issue
You mean the VAN Allen belts?Yeah um, James Van Allen himself said there's no issue going past them (There's 2 belts, btw)We went through them in 1964 with no issue. 
I was young.  What do you want?
Yup. Kermit just doesn't sound right now.
But he's Canadian so I'm letting that slide.
I agree, on the long term it can be a win-win, but short term if the problem is going to be solved the people who are trying to block storage sites have to lose.
I've actually seen that done before. It was worth every minute.
Sounds great, where do I sign up?
He asked if it should.  Not if it is.
ah, the old apple lock-in of death. I see.  I bet you've spent hundreds of iMusic too yes?Well, don't say I didn't warn you. Okay, I didn't warn you.

I got a real degree and never took psych, so nope
Oh whoops. Meant the other guy.
Nope I've been in 5 wedding parties so far and just nope
But most accidents happen because of *oh shit* things though, not just because of overuse of force. I think any injury that might last for a lifetime is fairly serious.
I like the blue/green combo. While your at it, change the green to black. That way you have a blue top for our aviation heritage then black for oil underneath. 
What is it with table top gaming and poly??  I mean it's adorable and I love all my table top gamers, but it seems like 80% of all poly people I've met are already in the middle of a game!
Insurance can be a great thing to have. Depending on what you're doing you may not need a permit. Here in Florida if the crew is less than 3 (I think) and you don't have a tripod you don't need a permit to film in public.
Ah, right. Makes sense. That's pretty much a full fun of sizes.
Gorgeous in a very *cute* way. 9/10 or so. Would attempt to convert.

I don't think boss was using corporate money.  Just that he covered for OP with corporate, and separately paid the fee.
Nice. The Sturm Panzer crest would be easy to do.
201, my son's birthday, I'd say it was a pretty lucky day. 
The commercial Internet is 20 years old.  Late bloomer, I would have to say based on your observation.
I probably will. I had given up on Autechre previous to hearing this comp, it's like, there is Autechre that i will like. Like i said, Amber was alright, i'm just much more of an Aphex Twin man myself
Night blue will be the hardest to keep clean. Reflex silver should be easy. Carbon steel is pretty much in between it gets dirty quick but doesn't look dirty from  10 feet away. I can get away without washing my car for about 2 weeks. 
Aww &lt;3I do it too sometimes. I think it's natural to offer advice, but if you keep pushing and pushing and pushing that advice it's like okay guys. Stahp. 
=[ At least try to find an electrical closet.
You are correct, but if I had continued on that path no one would be making a movement for me and I would die exactly where I belonged.
*I hold you close.* I love you, Adria. Magic or no, yer still Adria. That's all that's important, okay? 
It's too bad they never made another record after Tromp le Monde, I'd love to see how Pitchfork would treat a Pixies record that hasn't been out for 20 years.
It's a user generated content and news community filled with everything from the everyday to the deep subjects to the mundane to the extremely fringe and dirty.

I don't follow the Bundesliga that closely. Whatever happened to Dost? I remember he went on that tear a couple months back, but haven't heard anything since. He still playing well, or did he just have a spurt of good form?
Is his front tire on backwards?
What? No! That's not OK at all. Call the police!
...said Ripley to the android Bishop.
You're right. There's absolutely no evidence to suggest that PB is anything more than bisexual. There's also nothing to suggest that PB is outside the gender binary, either, so you really have nothing to apologize for. Your post was fine.
yeah, but thats pretty much the internet in general. I like these puffer jackets a lot but even if I didn't I wouldn't just be negative about it. 
Noooooo....Oh well.  I'll go ride my own route, with hookers and blackjack...
Amazon is apparently as dark and strange as the rest of the internet.

Tattle away. /u/lolabunbun doesn't scare me. 
Nah, Cisco and Caitlin would find you after your third or fourth casino. 
Nope, no fix. You've made it clear you want to talk, he has made it clear he doesn't want to. Perhaps he will change his mind over time, but you just have to respect that for now.
I don't have this problem at all. The problem I do have is the big lit up power button drawing the attention of my 1.5 year old daughter.I'll be in the middle of something and before I know whats happening, "windows is shuting down".

I'm a powerlifter/bodybuilder, 5'10", loading season I'm 290 lbs or so, I slim down to 255-260 for the summer, the difference in skating is ridiculous!  I'm so much faster and more agile, I also break less sticks!
Did you read the entire story? I wouldn't say that if I didn't believe it to be true. OP has certainly given enough. Thanks for the one line generalization though. 
So that makes the magic Bungie 7. 
I think tracksuits will come back into the mainstream, loose fitting track pants and windbreakers ... basically the 90s will be back for a bit longer. I think camo and 3M stuff will die out

Baby was not electrocuted, but I think we can all agree it was a dumbass thing to do and not recommended. Our parenting skills are an example of why there should be reproduction license tests. 
Not purely cosmetic.  Crowding can make it hard to brush or floss between teeth, which can lead to excess plaque.

For the USA, the mass incarceration of black men. There are a whole lot of ways to combat this like fighting against racism, but ending the war on drugs is the most effective way imo.
I went through 2 of them on my 2012 with 27k miles

Dont' go upstairs, ALWAYS shoot the bad guy in the HEAD.  TWICE.  Don't go with the black guy if they split up.  I would probably die, but I'd lay some pain down first.

That's the way to do it.  Nothing tears people apart like a wedding.

i agree with your assessment, in fact, I've sliced and diced the tracks to make a version where side one fades into Us and Them and carries on from there. Blasphemy, I'm sure, but whatever.

Sansa's relationship with Little Finger is creepy as fuck
That's an interesting take.. I personally disagree though, rape is rape, I feel introducing grey areas to acts that are technically rape is a slippery slope
Ah, so he'll only get the *blatant* racists
Can confirm. Purge does awesome narration and his videos are super helpful to watch. 
That's the general price for a custom last anywhere you go. Some places will build up a last for you for much cheaper, which is good enough for most people. Bespoke lasts truly are for people with foot issues or with lots of money.

Drag goes up as square of speed, but power needed (fuel used) is drag x distance.  Going twice as fast uses 8 times the fuel in the same time, or 4 times as much for the same distance.

Lol I really hope it's not just a bigger screen for iOS. I know I'll get downvoted but I think one of the reasons for the not stellar iPad sales is because the OS doesn't vary on the bigger screens. 
Not when you have a bunch of dead ones lying around.
Twas dad. I chopped the video up a bit to keep it short and stuck bits of audio on top of each other, so you're hearing my voice from one bit and my beats from another. Lucky we stayed in the groove! 
I was feeling guilty about making a video my kid will be mortified about when he's a teenager. Now it turns out it's a PSA about electrocuting babies. 
That's like your opinion man. Apparently the Muslims with guns disagreed. 
Based on my experience with German Porn, this is acceptable

That is absurd. You do not have to agree with the reasons for someone's choice or even the choice itself to be pro-choice.Sex selective abortions are bad because they stem from and reinforce the idea that women and girls are inferior.

Good reason why you shouldn't raise your beer bottle or solo cup when someone takes a picture of you.  And because it looks trashy.

Sometimes people get the joke, but the joke just isn't funny.
This should be easy to solve; the UK has CCTV everywhere.
People actually move out of the way for emergency vehicles in other places? Here in Los Angeles, you'd probably just get yelled at or shot. 
DID WE SERIOUSLY PASS OVER GUIDED BY VOICES AGAIN    ARE YOU KIDDING ME GUYS    ARE. YOU. KIDDING. ME.
That show went so far out there how could expect anything else?
I had a kid because accidents happen, but there's a lot of fun in now having the ability to show someone Star Wars, Ghostbusters, Jaws, Jurassic Park, and The Beatles.    And that's pretty dope.
But pissing on the graves of 1000 years worth of ancestors to hand your country over on a platter to muslims who have no problem beheading your soldiers in the street while everyone watches......*that's* truly civilized
If what you are is "a character played by god." How can you drop the act? 
It corners and handles extremely well for a 4500+ lb station wagon. But yeah that's what I would drive if I was a dad lol. 
Oh my god what is that horrible space monster attacking the earth!Wait, its just a smudge on the window, nevermind
Only things I don't really like are that you cut off its feet and that his placement in the frame doesn't feel balanced. Otherwise, it's pretty nice... Good textures and I really like the almost chiaroscuro style lighting. 
Is there an /r/momboobs or something along those lines with just pictures of mature tatas? I found /r/realolderwomen, but I'm looking for something that just shows their ripened melons and not their aged beef curtains. 
It think /u/M0b1us0ne is right, there's one west of Springdale on 412, you can see the concrete tower from the hiway (I think)If you run out of options, Modern Mission is a BLAST.  It's laser tag, but it's still very fun.
I don't wear hats and I probably wouldn't take my hat off.
You need to send me the video for it to be a submission. Send me a PM for instructions.
You look great, but picture 4 is by far the best. Too much distraction going on in the others.
Restraint and foresight is for sun singers, not Gunslingers. Although I roll 'Trance nowadays as I think it gives more benefit overall, but I immediately noticed combustion not combusting and turned it back on when I tried out Gunfighter. 
I just posted a quasi-poll to gather some reddit date in order to create a poll for PvP weapons. I'd appreciate your I put and feedback. Thanks. 
FWIW, Dayton has a better last, don't beat yourself up *too* much.
Just because you like the song they play every time doesn't mean you care that it's their shtick.
750cc in line 4.  Claimed 74 hp when new, is still in decent shape.  Also adding blue dots up front to stop it.
Damn it bruh! There goes my left over pizza lunch.
I am a fan of "a relatively old woman whom gives this boy a blow-job (oral sex)"
We could have done that before too. But we want it all for ourselves. Someone will.
Yeah, if you look day by day, it's busy for a month then nothing, then busy again....
I'm with you. I didn't think the ending was groundbreaking or surprising. I thought that the Lutece twins were far more interesting characters, and that their story was better. 
Not following her relentlessly until I stopped and spoke to her 19 years ago.Never be afraid, never stop chasing.
bowl. black beans. rice. fajita veg. pico. the fiery stuff. guac.i stuff it in my face one forkful at a time. that's about it.
I thought vitamin c at least had some semi compelling evidence of immune boosting properties.  Not a major effect but enough that it was statistically significant as long as you started immediately upon feeling ill. Did that turn out to be bull crap? 
Pretend that you were not the person who wrote this post and read it. Really read every word. Pretty fucked up, huh? What would you tell that person to do?
Indy will let Peyton go to pursue a rookie.
Wait... 33? I assumed you were a kid. How did it take you this long to discover the Dead? I'd love to hear this back story. Cheers. 
I was about to ask "she's rich, right?" But if she's doing 50 she's def not rich. 
Does he have any good qualities? Why are you with him beyond the fact that he has a pulse and a penis?
I have two older sisters and a younger,  adopted sister.   I get along great with all of them honestly.  My oldest sister and I get along best, but we are a close family that gets along and communicates well,  it's fun actually.  
TIL there's a market for commercial suborbital launches
Seriously? you can't think of a single way to handle a bad situation besides seriously injuring some girl? He could have told her to stop, for one.
Not especially - I'm in East Saint Paul.  I'm probably gonna ride down to LaCrosse next weekend, might be up to head Saint Cloud way some weekend after that.  TBH, I don't know the area very well, despite living here some time.
Oh yay! She better like it. &gt;:) She actually likes cats more than I do, so I'm sure we're good. ;) Thanks so much!
I'm an extra teeth person too. It's like... let's form the shitty X-Men team. Mutants with totally useless powers.

Well I mean, who wouldn't rather have chocolate milk?
That's a reverse fupa wedgie, cotton - I haven't seen that in a looong time. That's rare. Neat. 
I went on a mediterranean cruise two years ago. saw rome, genoa, marseilles, palma, barcelona, valencia. miss it terribly. I've seen much of the united states too.
When i was a kid i thought after you got sunburned and our skin peeled off, the layer of skin below that was a different color. Like, you get sunburned, peels off, and you're black. Then you get sunburned, the next layer is white again.
rotting corpse and human fecessteak filet, medium and browned butter sauce
Get rid of that 'up next' autoplay they now have. Drives me insane.
God helps those who help themselves. 
Heh. This is true. But he is still only 28.
To some. As it ages, the toe box develops small ripples if unstructured. 
They probably aren't in Maine. They could wander around forever just looking for someone to attack.
Onder telegraafjournalisten ook.
That sub produces a disproportionate amount of drama.
If you got a loss it's something different. They got a loss too. What OP described gives you a win and the other team nothing. 
Ohh you meant A beater car that "only" lasts 5-6 years is a decent car. Not&gt;A car that "only" lasts 5-6 years is a decent car. Makes sense I withdraw my weird face
It'd be misleading if there wasn't a beer can being used. I'd rank it less misleading than cheesecake, which contains no cake, or chicken fried steak, which ain't got shit to do with chicken.It's all about your own expectations. 
Honestly, Doom is still one of the most under developed characters in Marvel's arsenal. I would love to see a cross over with Doom and Luther.
What sort of trouble are you trying to prevent?
I'm a dad, and I have 10% body fat.  That's a proper dad bod that your wife and children will respect.  
The problem with statistics is they will make you stereotype a whole group of people.
Christ, I love it when this happens. Dude gets all defeny, people tear him to shreds over it. Perfect.    Bet the dude assumed it was a Black Eyed Peas song or something. Probably didn't know better than to fuck with Tribe.
Tim and the team at Apple now are great but nobody comes close to Steve giving keynotes. The iPhone is the top point but every one is great, so natural. 
As someone who grew up with cats...  that was not unexpected.  Cats go from chill to bath-salts in no time.
I think that's a vandals cover band 
Surprised I had to come this far down for the obvious Portal 2 reference 
Uhhhh thanks, but we would prefer to be paid an extra $5k
If I were him I would be more afraid of class warfare. 
I also got a wife and a baby. Partied like a rock star, now adulting like a pro
Serious question: why do people respect fire fighters so much but detest cops?  Edit: I can take my downvotes like a man, do your worst
Well, I'm 34 and I just want to say... if you're a twenty-something that hasn't had sex in the last year, but want to... call me.
Meanwhile, they infected everything around them, like your kitchen counter that you had all your other food resting on.
Yup. I've been the other guy a few times, and generally it's a very pleasant situation to be in. Not exactly moral high ground though, I'd be forced to admit.
It was actually the Meat Puppets that guested at Unplugged. The Vaselines did join Nirvana on stage once (Eugene did) at the Reading Festival
Mate they've been playing on the BBC in the UK. It's everywhere. 
If you want to take them home with you afterward then it's a deal!         Did we just go from a date to you babysitting my kids? 
He's not really wrong. Youth is pretty universally a feature of attractiveness. 
Program will have run out of money and been cancelled by then.
Who's going to pay to take it to court?
Blatter has to be shitting himself.
all I could think is, kidnapping and torture is something Mexicans deal with on a daily basis in a way most Americans can't understand. So I wonder how much of that is desensitization to their society's out-of-whack norms.
This pisses me off so much I don't even know what to say.
As the BBC puts it he is either complicit or incompetent.
I totally sing that one in the band... Maybe that's where my date got it from!
Pizza. easy win. Already eat it everyday
Shippers work for free?  I didn't know that!  Good to know.  Next time I talk to the UPS guy, I'll ask how he makes ends meet.  &lt;sarcasm&gt;
TL;DR: he didn't ride eternal, shiny or chrome. Valhalla ended up being pretty lonely for a guy with 5 wives. 
Lifted a motorcycle with one hand.  Adrenaline and shock after an accident is crazy.
I didn't.  I just left it.  It was in the woods, with my napkin toilet paper.
Fucking non stop emails go right to spam
Oh, he knows. He should be punished with a high five.
I feel like you probably knew about /r/good_cop_free_donut and got the rest by looking at "related subreddits" on the sidebars of some obvious ones.Yes, I'm overly cynical.
I am the very model of a scientist Salarian.
Politicians and the corrupt do. 
I was confused by it. It was easier to see the plot holes with an explanation. I couldn't see the others it was like a bunch of random movie pictures
Yes I have held a newborn and I can tell you that it is not the second as pregnancy at all. For example, the baby is literally not inside the woman's body. That makes a huge difference when you are discussing the issue of women's bodies.
Yes, I bought it, I was already in the workforce and had lots of disposable income relative to my peers.  I wasn't rich, I simply didn't save any money.  ;)
When you have those moments, just tell yourself STOP. Say it out loud if you have to. You've been abused for a long time. It's going to have lasting effects.
Looks almost identical to the current Lexus IS 
Well, reading the sidebar *is* impossible for people on (many) mobile platforms.
Front pocket thin one.  I like to reduce mine even further, but it's pretty thin as is.
Seems true for human teenagers.
If you can, it is *always* better to try shoes on in person.

Urgently needed weather sats.  Matter of national security that potus has accurate golf weather forecast 
Anything can be a thing if you just use your imagination!
I haven't been in school in nearly a decade. Nice attempt at an insult, though, sorry the insinuation that I'm young didn't get me all riled up like you were hoping.    Now fuck off, you pathetic little shit.
WEAPON AND ARMOR CORES GIVE YOU LEGENDARY GEAR!!!  THEY ARE LEGENDARY DROPS!!!
You're right!  I meant tom cruise but in my frenzy I typed Hanks!  Lol. 
They're really more details I'd have to *feel* or things like the innards that you can't know without taking it apart.I appreciate the effort though, this was an excellent contribution!
Only 90s kids remember gang rape!!!
Sure, I get it, but it seems like there were lots of ways to avoid it that didn't involve begging their dad.
Still better than Paste, they tossed that spoiler into a fucking headline.
That's a new one. *I wave as you leave.* Toodleloo!
I've never had a problem with this.  I'm on CM12.1.  I use bluetooth everyday to stream music.

That's awesome.  you too, don't get anything on that awesome shirt or you're a commie bastard.;-)
I know this feel, bro.Wanna share some Werther's candy and yell at these damn kids on my lawn?
Is he volunteering to go shopping?
No, they just have different views about what it means and what each relationship should look like. To say they don't understand marriage because they don't share your views on it is ridiculous.
Even if that is true, it's not a very good defense.
click the gear in the bottom left area of the galaxy client. It should say where it is installing (if you haven't specified otherwise it defaults to your main drive/gog games)
I don't think she asked for the open relationship. I think she asked her husband for a physical relationship over and over and he said open relationship as a solution. She doesn't really seem that interested in fucking other people.
Yeah, I'll show you my "passport"! \*reaches down front of pants, producing an actual passport\* ... what?
I'm on mobile or I'd link you.   Search just this subreddit for dunk asteroid. It's the only result
Richmond, VA is the same way.  They also have abandoned streetcar rails in the roads.
I'm sorry, I'm totally lost on the motivation part of this.
Just stop. I really don't understand your goal at all right now. 
Protip: don't argue with a tiger or bring up the thumbs thing.
Well you haven't been murdered in any weird horror movie fashion, so there's that.
You're about to have a cheetah spine. You better say that shit with confidence!"I'M GONNA KILL A MOTHERFUCKING GAZELLE!"
This needs to be the final episode of the Simpsons.

That motherfucker might have stopped counting at 300 lbs, but there is no way in hell he's only three hunnit.  Shit, I'M almost 300 and he's taller and way fatter than I am. 
Lindseth is the largest climbing wall in the country, I've heard

Met die verticale uitsparingen zou het ook maar zo kunnen zijn dat er een tijdelijke dam mee kan worden gemaakt door er een plaat in te schuiven.
I used to be a telemarketer back in the day, other people did that to so if put my feet up and play around with ms paint or solitaire, then schedule a call back 
my SO.  not only is she my "person" in every way, but she'd be incredibly handy in this particular situation....
I can't believe I'm saying this, but it looks like GM finally made a performance coupe with a decent looking ass. The CTS-V always makes me shudder.
Please respond in iambic pentameter while playing fetch with this border collie.
After reading feedback on this post do you realize how fucked up your girls attitude is?
im ready for the downvotes but how did you get it to show the price in NZ on steam? im in Australia and mine is always in USEdit: also nice bargain there
The way this guy is dressed, finding him near John and Adelaide would be like finding Waldo in the Land of Waldos.
Or was it a Leg in Fishnets Lamp?
Holy fuck I'm going to do this when I'm a dad. 
If you are really constipated, even if you have lots of good friends, you probably still need an enema.
Wrong thread to be talking about Jameis.
Will it look better than shit, as it does currently on 3DS XL, when not in native pixel mode?  If so, I'm in.
Yeah replace the cabin filters it's a quick 10 minute job it's located under the passenger side dash, there's two little screws you undo and then pull off the trim and you'll see it in there. 
Why? Losing your virginity is really not a big deal, at all.
Hmm, why? That just means they had to get that money from the rest of us instead.
Nice. Well, i hope your raging boner is taken care of by a hot, young babe. 
I watched that loop a dozen times and it gets funnier each time. I dropped a tear when I began noticing the guy on the far left being nicked back by nothing
Guess you'll think next time before sneak attacking us, wont you?No sympathy here. You fuck with the bull, you get the horns

Thank you both for explaining!You'd think lower or higher bail should depend on the income of the accused, but that's not the way this works apparently.
I'm a dad. 6'1", 170 lbs. No beer belly here. I can tell you 100% that fat girls like dad bods the way undocumented immigrants love rusted pickup trucks. If they could do better, they would. 
Thats how I feel as a 35 year old also.
The video clip is even better because it's got the audio of the two Russians in the POV car saying hilarious sounding Russian shit and laughing that throat-scraping Russian laugh. 
I could do without the Pall Malls....but damn now I want a brisket.
So she only writes on one side of the page.
Because junkie is so much better :)
He should have gotten a guy Brazilian 
Did you get white or colored by any chance?  edit: nvm. Looks like they only sell white.  I will give them a try too. Thanks.
I don't think we have enough information to really know where Battlefront is. At this point all of the outright hate is a little misguided.
You may be right, but consider that the screen size of the Transformer is 10.1 inches. Screen size or performance? You have to make sacrifices at this price point.
Or that first time they fall down / fall off the bed? PANIC. Everytime after that? "Meh. Made of rubber"
That time I gassed 6 million jews.
Fewer working days I think would work best for me.  That would give me whole days with my SO.  I would enjoy 3-4 workdays per week instead of 5.  Honestly, I've often thought that the "8-5 Monday-Friday" is random and stupid to enforce.
Went to high school with kid who played the young version of Sean Penn's character in Mystic River... Sean Penn was in Mystic River with Kevin Bacon. Boom.
Alison Brie.But also the like harcore hitting shit. No one needs that.

I eat my poached eggs with a fork.  Is that wrong? 
Relax, swim **across** it (ie parallel to the beach) to where the water is calmer, then swim back in once you are out of it. After my personal experience, I would also put in signalling an arm up for help somewhere in there too.
I'd forgotten about TV actually, and the massive licensing deals for the world cup.
I will be *completely* shocked if this doesn't happen.
Huh, so it ties shifting to the ECU?  Did not know that.

What's that got nothing to do with how a woman binds with her baby.
I'm a dad.  When I want something (and there's money), I buy it.  This spring I bought myself a motorcycle.  I don't really even want to give my money to my wife and kid so they can buy me something I might not even want.
Also for us maritimers it's old news we've been watching since the beginning whereas the current level of fame is because of Netflix picking it up, I remember several years ago bbc America picked it up and it didn't go over all that well. 
The comment was deleted, but I just peeked through that guy's comment history and he is a *real* piece of work. Apparently he's a mod on a hilariously awful racist subreddit that I won't name. What did his comment here say? 
Bjork at Carnegie Hall. It was amazing
Hi Sera!Welcome to the sub! That /u/TheMasterCthulhu guy is pretty alright. 
Sure, but AJ does plenty of mocking himself, so I'm not too bothered by that, I guess.
I've heard of that ride before. Arrow had batwings on a lot of their rides, i guess that is pretty close to a cobra roll too
I know this would be a great joke for it ! So now we know cats, dogs, babies, and apparently drunk people like laser pointers 
That changes with the day but desserts are my jam. Pies soups.
