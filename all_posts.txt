Hmm, why? That just means they had to get that money from the rest of us instead.
Nice. Well, i hope your raging boner is taken care of by a hot, young babe. 
I watched that loop a dozen times and it gets funnier each time. I dropped a tear when I began noticing the guy on the far left being nicked back by nothing
Guess you'll think next time before sneak attacking us, wont you?No sympathy here. You fuck with the bull, you get the horns
Oh let's just throw more money at the problem it will solve everything

Thank you both for explaining!You'd think lower or higher bail should depend on the income of the accused, but that's not the way this works apparently.
I'm a dad. 6'1", 170 lbs. No beer belly here. I can tell you 100% that fat girls like dad bods the way undocumented immigrants love rusted pickup trucks. If they could do better, they would. 
Thats how I feel as a 35 year old also.
The video clip is even better because it's got the audio of the two Russians in the POV car saying hilarious sounding Russian shit and laughing that throat-scraping Russian laugh. 
I could do without the Pall Malls....but damn now I want a brisket.
So she only writes on one side of the page.
Because junkie is so much better :)
He should have gotten a guy Brazilian 
Did you get white or colored by any chance?  edit: nvm. Looks like they only sell white.  I will give them a try too. Thanks.
I don't think we have enough information to really know where Battlefront is. At this point all of the outright hate is a little misguided.
You may be right, but consider that the screen size of the Transformer is 10.1 inches. Screen size or performance? You have to make sacrifices at this price point.
Or that first time they fall down / fall off the bed? PANIC. Everytime after that? "Meh. Made of rubber"
That time I gassed 6 million jews.
Fewer working days I think would work best for me.  That would give me whole days with my SO.  I would enjoy 3-4 workdays per week instead of 5.  Honestly, I've often thought that the "8-5 Monday-Friday" is random and stupid to enforce.
Went to high school with kid who played the young version of Sean Penn's character in Mystic River... Sean Penn was in Mystic River with Kevin Bacon. Boom.
Alison Brie.But also the like harcore hitting shit. No one needs that.
I remember:        Ich spiele fusball.        Spielen wir es tut mir leich? 
I eat my poached eggs with a fork.  Is that wrong? 
Relax, swim **across** it (ie parallel to the beach) to where the water is calmer, then swim back in once you are out of it. After my personal experience, I would also put in signalling an arm up for help somewhere in there too.
I'd forgotten about TV actually, and the massive licensing deals for the world cup.
I will be *completely* shocked if this doesn't happen.
Huh, so it ties shifting to the ECU?  Did not know that.

What's that got nothing to do with how a woman binds with her baby.
I'm a dad.  When I want something (and there's money), I buy it.  This spring I bought myself a motorcycle.  I don't really even want to give my money to my wife and kid so they can buy me something I might not even want.
Also for us maritimers it's old news we've been watching since the beginning whereas the current level of fame is because of Netflix picking it up, I remember several years ago bbc America picked it up and it didn't go over all that well. 
The comment was deleted, but I just peeked through that guy's comment history and he is a *real* piece of work. Apparently he's a mod on a hilariously awful racist subreddit that I won't name. What did his comment here say? 
Bjork at Carnegie Hall. It was amazing
Hi Sera!Welcome to the sub! That /u/TheMasterCthulhu guy is pretty alright. 
Sure, but AJ does plenty of mocking himself, so I'm not too bothered by that, I guess.
I've heard of that ride before. Arrow had batwings on a lot of their rides, i guess that is pretty close to a cobra roll too
I know this would be a great joke for it ! So now we know cats, dogs, babies, and apparently drunk people like laser pointers 
That changes with the day but desserts are my jam. Pies soups. 
I find it hard to believe Wilt never did this though...
It's Plasti Dip. It's fucking shit.
&gt; Like I'd bet somehow in the future, the Jimbei cover story will be relevant.He found a poneglyph, then was shown with a poneglyph-sized cube as he was leaving. It will definitely be relevant.

Yeah but the inside of your egg will be cooked and won't come into contact with your other food while sitting on your counter/in your fridge.

&gt;These industry representatives have secured billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies to produce and market the very foods that make us sick.That sentence has a lot of what is wrong with America crammed into relatively few characters.

This website has a fucking menu button for Gamergate. What a bunch of dickbags.    And since when is a PS4 nearly $700?    EDIT: holy shit is this some Return Of Kings knockoff I wasn't aware of?
Well, I'm glad I haven't been on the internet long enough that I've become desensitized to things like that. That person is disgusting. He sounds like a fucking cartoon villain. How the hell do people like this exist?
The "perfect design" they are famous for died a few years ago with Steve Jobs. They have been making a lot of stang decisions lately that I don't think he would have signed off on. 
On the playground is where they don't spend any of their days
Baby was not electrocuted, but I think we can all agree it was a dumbass thing to do and not recommended. Our parenting skills are an example of why there should be reproduction license tests. 
Not purely cosmetic.  Crowding can make it hard to brush or floss between teeth, which can lead to excess plaque.  
What? Weird racial allusions aside, I downvote things that do not contribute to the discussion. Like concern trolling.
Sanchez had a very solid passer rating through both those runs. To be fair.
You could buy an 8th gen si for same price lol

For the USA, the mass incarceration of black men. There are a whole lot of ways to combat this like fighting against racism, but ending the war on drugs is the most effective way imo.
I went through 2 of them on my 2012 with 27k miles

Dont' go upstairs, ALWAYS shoot the bad guy in the HEAD.  TWICE.  Don't go with the black guy if they split up.  I would probably die, but I'd lay some pain down first.
&gt; That can be doubled to six years if you omitted more then 25% of your income or $5,000.00 in foreign income.Which can't be determined unless they audit you?
That's the way to do it.  Nothing tears people apart like a wedding.

i agree with your assessment, in fact, I've sliced and diced the tracks to make a version where side one fades into Us and Them and carries on from there. Blasphemy, I'm sure, but whatever.

You need the southbend drop in disc. Oem clutch would just go bad. And they wouldn't cover it under warranty lol. Also the only two domino effect items I can think of would be coilpacks and possibly s diverted valve

Aw man, me too. I couldn't understand why nothing was getting called on Favre. I would have handled losing to that dude in the Super Bowl a lot easier too.

Ridiculous. But thanks for the example!

Sansa's relationship with Little Finger is creepy as fuck
That's an interesting take.. I personally disagree though, rape is rape, I feel introducing grey areas to acts that are technically rape is a slippery slope
Ah, so he'll only get the *blatant* racists
Can confirm. Purge does awesome narration and his videos are super helpful to watch. 
That's the general price for a custom last anywhere you go. Some places will build up a last for you for much cheaper, which is good enough for most people. Bespoke lasts truly are for people with foot issues or with lots of money.

Drag goes up as square of speed, but power needed (fuel used) is drag x distance.  Going twice as fast uses 8 times the fuel in the same time, or 4 times as much for the same distance.

Lol I really hope it's not just a bigger screen for iOS. I know I'll get downvoted but I think one of the reasons for the not stellar iPad sales is because the OS doesn't vary on the bigger screens. 
Not when you have a bunch of dead ones lying around.
Twas dad. I chopped the video up a bit to keep it short and stuck bits of audio on top of each other, so you're hearing my voice from one bit and my beats from another. Lucky we stayed in the groove! 
I was feeling guilty about making a video my kid will be mortified about when he's a teenager. Now it turns out it's a PSA about electrocuting babies. 
That's like your opinion man. Apparently the Muslims with guns disagreed.

That is absurd. You do not have to agree with the reasons for someone's choice or even the choice itself to be pro-choice.Sex selective abortions are bad because they stem from and reinforce the idea that women and girls are inferior.

Good reason why you shouldn't raise your beer bottle or solo cup when someone takes a picture of you.  And because it looks trashy.

NBC News ran a report on that topic a couple of weeks ago.  Some guy in Austin estimated an "enterprising" person doing that type of work full time, i.e. dumper diving for tech in high tech areas, could pull in 100K per year USD, quite easily.

You should volunteer at college, trying to improve your GPA. Because that actually matters (to law schools).You could *cure cancer* and law school admissions still wouldn't give a fuck, because they can't report that to US News.

Yes. Other schools had weighted GPA, but ours didn't.
It's amazing. Last week I posted a musical fart that got 2 million views, and the comments were overwhelmingly positive.
How about high crime area...and predom - oh wait, nevermind.
He killed his entire family because an imaginary being told him to.  Seems open and shut.
That's not how any of this works
No you are just limiting it to something your GPU can actually handle. I haven't noticed any changes to anything other than Hairworks hair. 
And that one asshole is the biggest piece of crap
So your way of dealing with your anxiety and self esteem issues is to censor things like photos of you?Sounds more like not dealing with the issues.

Sorry. I read it as cheap and meant to type cheap tactic, but put cheat in there instead. I had just replied to a post about cheating and must have still had it on my kind. 
Fuck yeah, Malek. You schooled Dax. 
It's not a good solution to the problem at hand.   Creating heat is actually one of the. Out energy efficient things we know how to do.  When heat is the primary product 
Please, that would involve thinking about others. 
Holy crap, get those PSA graded promptly. 
Photo-Resistive circuits... This could be difficult
*internet high five*I go back to using gopher on my 2400 baud via my mom's uni dialup account (circa 92, I think?)It's been quite a ride. I am grateful to have been born at the right time to get the perspective I did. 
Okay, fair enough....for your circumstances but for somebody just going to Univeristy, I'm going to need a little bit more convincing.
Pick something (a specific shelf in the pantry, a light bulb in a spot that makes the MOST sense) and break it or empty the shelf.  About half the time.  HA!  
You people love 'em. My 11 year old, can't wait to use the manual till in TEscos
I went to a liberal arts school.  There were plenty of protesters.
Do you want to build a snowman?
Then what do you suggest? Am I supposed to throw my shit plastered wet wipe in the garbage? Do you want to take the garbage out several times a say, because I don't.
For now. Until FEMA gets involved. 
(sigh).... if 70% of the movie is done via CGI.. then the cost and trouble of shooting IMAX seems a bit unnecessary since CGI is independent of the quality of filming. Also thought that pic was just funny. :)
What about a central authority that doesn't violate your bodily autonomy?
I guess you've never had their fish n chips. Its just fried batter and soggy sadness.
I don't! But the day you launch, I will proudly hail you!
These invasive species will be...  *missed*.
The xbox live support page and XBL have both Ben on and off all day for me. Well at 7:30am it gave me fits but I finally got in about 8:00am then after work about 4:30 I couldn't get in and still couldn't as of 6:30. Central US
I don't know what the stereotype is, but I know I'm not it.
Was he on probation?  Can people on probation carry knives on their person?  Not sure, not an attorney, but it might help explain why he ran.
I keep reading the last name as Adebisi (from Oz)
&gt;take one QB from Indy and now you think you can just snatch another?2! They took Elway too.
That would be a relevant analogy if we were training japanese jiu jitsu.
What are the ancient alien guys going to do now?
I don't want to sound cliché, but the messages in his song "Waiting For The Beat To Kick In" really help me put my head on straight during a rough time.
If you have no clue that's not great. Either way, tell her the truth and see how things go. 
You could buy a decent house with cash and have the rest put away for your yearly taxes/utilities. You'd pretty much only need to work for food/pleasure money. 
How does that work? Are they processing more instructions per cycle or something? 
I agree.  I'm up by at 7 at the latest on the weekend.
Yeah I mean it's generally aimed towards a younger audience but you shouldn't care what other people think. Just get what you want and enjoy it, the gti is a fantastic car.

IT COULD ALMOST BE NEARING AN ACTUAL DOLLAR AT SOME POINT!
Considering the average cost of people's collections here are around 10 grand, it's not *that* crazy. Plenty of people have significantly more valuable collections.But I agree, having that kind of money is unfathomable.
Even s 28" inseam feels too short for no break on me.
Most of the Facebook BST groups here are gross. Yay Houston. I'll check around though, since my wife may know of a few I haven't seen.Might as well try listing on Craigslist and see what happens. 
It's a black and blue dress regardless what color your heathen eyes see...that has been conclusively proven.
You got me, I'm terrible with theory. :)
A beautiful cabin on a small peice of land someplace far enough North that at night,  we could watch the northern lights from the bedroom.   That.   
Time to stream Alien and Aliens.  I think you can skip Alien 3 unless you really want more.  Alien Resurrection was horrible.
Beautiful, wonderful idea. A 1000 times yes.
As a Ducks fan, and Colts fan, damn I'm torn. The kid is gonna be a serious blow to our playoff hopes for the next 15 years.
Watch dutch television, go to 'teletekst' and set it to page 888. That way you can listen and read subtitles at the same time.
We're grateful for you too!!1!!!111!!!111!!111 :D
Check [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofamazon/wiki/faq#wiki_how_did_this_all_get_started.3F) out.Lola's right of course. Ours is the best. ;)
Noooo I give up, it's just me in the woods, don't fucking shoot me plz bae
Me too. I've always thought that should be the case. 
The hardest part is the measuring (and it's not that hard). Once you get everything measured and cut, it's maybe 40 seconds of sewing and 90 seconds of pressing.
Modern, Pepe's, Sally's, Bar are all good.There's a wood fired place in Southington that's good too.
Dante's Inferno. Satan's got a nice level for fatties.👿 
this game has too many f'in blinks already 
...while stealing back her own purse!"
I have heard most guys like it if you do a play by play of what's happening in an old timey sports announcer voice. J/K, you should really be asking him for these examples. 
Wights are any human corpse reanimated by the White Walkers.  The White Walkers are a separate, magical race that live in The Lands of Always Winter.
Nothing. Mythbusters busted the myth of anything bad happening. Check out the episode, they even have adam savage hold his eyes open while sneezing is glorious slow motion.
No class can prepare you for babies.You'll be faced with all kinds of decisions all the time.Just do what you think is best. Be on the same page as the mom. Let them experiment, get hurt, and play.You'll do a good job.
Oh god that's cute! I can't wait until I'm a dad
If you're both honest and trust each other, then yes, go for it.
Better fucking make enough for all of us.We'll send /u/LolaBunBun to break your fucking knees if you don't.
To be fair, not a lot spurs people to action in america.
Technically glass-steagall was repealed under Clinton, which most experts see as precipitating the crisis
This is interesting to me. I've fixed them, loaded rockets and missiles and now I fly them, but I've never loaded the gun. I'll see if I can find out what that last/first round is all about
I just re-read the title.  I'm American, I totally skipped over the "Non-americans or Reddit" part.  Sorry.
There is literally a KFC across the street from the Sphynx, I swear to god.
Bet my wife would have rather UPS delivered the baby. A signature would have been a lot easier.
Because I don't believe that they actually can be decoupled.
Good good. I'll return to pounding your momma from behind. 
Two days for a half hours worth of what dad shows you when you're 7?
I do the exact same thing. I love my frickin ergo. Allows me to play videogames while also being a responsible parent... AND I get a workout, because I'm pacing back and forth *while* playing
So you're saying...  there's a chance?
This is just terrible, like the worst response
I'm joking man but yeah lower  your car. And uh depending like if you got coilovers you could just throw the stock suspension back in if you needed warranty work 
Fake guitars go hand in hand with their fake problems
No, he's asking for a super flashy anime series to totally ruin the look and feel of the Witcher.
Oh low call volume is another issue
You mean the VAN Allen belts?Yeah um, James Van Allen himself said there's no issue going past them (There's 2 belts, btw)We went through them in 1964 with no issue. 
I was young.  What do you want?
Yup. Kermit just doesn't sound right now.
But he's Canadian so I'm letting that slide.
I agree, on the long term it can be a win-win, but short term if the problem is going to be solved the people who are trying to block storage sites have to lose.
I've actually seen that done before. It was worth every minute.
Sounds great, where do I sign up?
He asked if it should.  Not if it is.
ah, the old apple lock-in of death. I see.  I bet you've spent hundreds of iMusic too yes?Well, don't say I didn't warn you. Okay, I didn't warn you.
You will never be as happy as a dog
Did they have the DH in Canaan?
3:15am? Must be a younger atheist. I get all my dark lord prayers by 1am.
When *Texans* call you wacko, you know you done screwed up.
Better title: "corporate slave dog tragically thinks camera is a gun"
I got a real degree and never took psych, so nope
Oh whoops. Meant the other guy.
Nope I've been in 5 wedding parties so far and just nope
But most accidents happen because of *oh shit* things though, not just because of overuse of force. I think any injury that might last for a lifetime is fairly serious.
I like the blue/green combo. While your at it, change the green to black. That way you have a blue top for our aviation heritage then black for oil underneath. 
What is it with table top gaming and poly??  I mean it's adorable and I love all my table top gamers, but it seems like 80% of all poly people I've met are already in the middle of a game!
Insurance can be a great thing to have. Depending on what you're doing you may not need a permit. Here in Florida if the crew is less than 3 (I think) and you don't have a tripod you don't need a permit to film in public.
Ah, right. Makes sense. That's pretty much a full fun of sizes.
Gorgeous in a very *cute* way. 9/10 or so. Would attempt to convert.
Tucked in is *I'm a dad and don't care what I'm wearing as long as it covers my body*.
I don't think boss was using corporate money.  Just that he covered for OP with corporate, and separately paid the fee.
Nice. The Sturm Panzer crest would be easy to do.
201, my son's birthday, I'd say it was a pretty lucky day. 
The commercial Internet is 20 years old.  Late bloomer, I would have to say based on your observation.
I probably will. I had given up on Autechre previous to hearing this comp, it's like, there is Autechre that i will like. Like i said, Amber was alright, i'm just much more of an Aphex Twin man myself
Night blue will be the hardest to keep clean. Reflex silver should be easy. Carbon steel is pretty much in between it gets dirty quick but doesn't look dirty from  10 feet away. I can get away without washing my car for about 2 weeks. 
Aww &lt;3I do it too sometimes. I think it's natural to offer advice, but if you keep pushing and pushing and pushing that advice it's like okay guys. Stahp. 
=[ At least try to find an electrical closet.
You are correct, but if I had continued on that path no one would be making a movement for me and I would die exactly where I belonged.
*I hold you close.* I love you, Adria. Magic or no, yer still Adria. That's all that's important, okay? 
It's too bad they never made another record after Tromp le Monde, I'd love to see how Pitchfork would treat a Pixies record that hasn't been out for 20 years.
It's a user generated content and news community filled with everything from the everyday to the deep subjects to the mundane to the extremely fringe and dirty.
I don't know that it's relevant to what I'm posting.  
huh, OK.Did you choose to be straight?
You can create statistics to prove anything, 14% of people know that.
I believe that woman's planning to shoot me again.
♫*Squirrels!* Who run the world... *Squirrels!* Who run the world...♫Now just TRY listening to Beyonce without thinking about that
That's a crane fly, not a mosquito.
I don't follow the Bundesliga that closely. Whatever happened to Dost? I remember he went on that tear a couple months back, but haven't heard anything since. He still playing well, or did he just have a spurt of good form?
Is his front tire on backwards?
What? No! That's not OK at all. Call the police!
...said Ripley to the android Bishop.
You're right. There's absolutely no evidence to suggest that PB is anything more than bisexual. There's also nothing to suggest that PB is outside the gender binary, either, so you really have nothing to apologize for. Your post was fine.
yeah, but thats pretty much the internet in general. I like these puffer jackets a lot but even if I didn't I wouldn't just be negative about it. 
Noooooo....Oh well.  I'll go ride my own route, with hookers and blackjack...
Amazon is apparently as dark and strange as the rest of the internet.
&gt;In iced latte form.Yummmmm
Tattle away. /u/lolabunbun doesn't scare me. 
Nah, Cisco and Caitlin would find you after your third or fourth casino. 
Nope, no fix. You've made it clear you want to talk, he has made it clear he doesn't want to. Perhaps he will change his mind over time, but you just have to respect that for now.
I don't have this problem at all. The problem I do have is the big lit up power button drawing the attention of my 1.5 year old daughter.I'll be in the middle of something and before I know whats happening, "windows is shuting down".
Wouldn't this be private information? Posting someone's name on the sub. 
The next pair of oxfords I get are either Carmina or Enzo Bonafé.I literally never have to wear oxfords, though.
I think tipping 100% does make you stand out, but as my friends int he service industry tell me, you will get better service next time.  I try to tip 30-50%, especially at places I regularly go. 
Never "cowboy" open or close a revolver. You bend the pin and you're fuckedhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GspksqvtO3k
This guy is seriously ridiculous
Awwwwwwwwww is really the noise they make when they disembowl their prey
My dad used to love Big Dogs shit. Which makes perfect sense, my dad is a total fucking douchebag.
I'm a powerlifter/bodybuilder, 5'10", loading season I'm 290 lbs or so, I slim down to 255-260 for the summer, the difference in skating is ridiculous!  I'm so much faster and more agile, I also break less sticks!
Did you read the entire story? I wouldn't say that if I didn't believe it to be true. OP has certainly given enough. Thanks for the one line generalization though. 
So that makes the magic Bungie 7. 
I think tracksuits will come back into the mainstream, loose fitting track pants and windbreakers ... basically the 90s will be back for a bit longer. I think camo and 3M stuff will die out 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Tortoise does have a pretty nice ring to it though
Assuming my SO also swapped, we would fuck like bunnies and see what it feels like for the other person.  it would be awesome.
Good job op. We need more male hams to poke fun at.
&gt;Most atheists do that partYe sure&gt;Unless you picked the wrong one or the omniscient deity knows you've been fakingNah as I understand it you get credit for going through the motions.  
Someone was really lazy about taking down their Christmas lights
it's not an absolute. does your body look like it's a memo pad or a work of art? surely you can tell the difference.
He's a self-serving prick. They always make sure that no matter who has to get fucked, they make out ok. 
What does lesser badged cars mean to you 
&gt; say Lazel have similar tank rankingWhy do you keep referring to Lazel? Is there anything special about him?

Haven't moved there yet... But it's on the table
If Moses shows up and taps his staff on the rocks, water will flow out of them, causing a flood.
Bad luck Dr. Brian Decepticon will probably find some other 6'3" dude in a red Ford and go in for the hug, but get his block knocked off in the process.
I'm assuming you mean add 2 inches to my penis.  I'm 6'2" with an 8.5 inch dick.  I don't want 10 inches of dick, and I don't want to be 7'8" either.  I pick neither.
How many California things do tv and movies get wrong that you look at and catch immediately?
Patents. Eagle works doesn't own this technology.   Some British researchers created it
So not true. Although I'm not really up on the younger radio indie bands.
But how would learning those two definitions change that people call things by the wrong name?
Depends on where you live and how much snow you get..chances are if he's buying used it not on the original tires anyways 
Exactly. And the way this has been treated is known to compound the effects on the victims. This is a real textbook example of an abusive family system. Everyone protects the abuser.
"... finding a competent store rep..."  LOL!
This is a good one.  I hadn't considered it.
Honestly its a tie between Snatch and The Big Lebowski.
Give them dog treats and lock them in a room.
&gt; Mid City Internet Cafe Thank you!
God. Damn. 10x my speed, half the price.
What conversation is there to be had about websites using advertisements? As long as they aren't PirateBaying it up and slapping porn ads all over the place, what does it matter?
Not even a little. C'mon. *I take your hand.*
If you have the drill stationary and move the shoe you could do it. I don't see why you wouldn't just use a $60 awl haft and blade.
Side cars seem kinda awesome. At the rate my daughterneice is growing, she'll probably be able to reach the door boards when she is 18 or 19.
I was going to say don't get crepe, it's not easy to work with. Christy soles you can just shave or sand down, though.
The one on the jacket looks like the one from amazon i linked to. I have a big Rat Fink patch on my jacket.  That's just how those patches look- sharp and clean, not at all fuzzy.
Probably the firing pins are not exactly the same, so the detonations happen a microsecond or so apart.
Hey scoobdrew, I'm Joshua. Glad you decided to pop in with an intro!
This needs to be on a tshirt. You're making me want to get back into screenprinting!
A lot of kids play these  https://youtu.be/w-j1xY71IJc
I do indeed. Anyone who believes that God had sex with Mary is a liar at best. 
I think he was just looking for attention, dude. check his name.
Paying for clothes, that's nice... My go to tshirts are those I get from participating in sports events.My favourite is coming up 8 years old!
I've got a good one, you have to start it.
And us shitlords are training to fight each other to the death for your affections.
Downvoted for "so many men".  From the fucked up shit I've seen on this sub, women and men are both crazy.
No it's cool, I mean, I can take credit anyway. Woo! I'm awesome!
At least one of them is actively mormon. Not that it matters but I remember it anytime somebody brings them up.
I appreciate that you really took the sub's name to heart, nice work.

Got it. Never bought from UM, I just know their CS and website is abysmal.**Closeout sale! Here's 189 pages of items with no sorting mechanism!**
Charge backs generally have to be done within a period of time—something like 6 months.
I really need to pull this into illustrator and fix it when I get home.  Those artifacts are making me crazy.
Gronk plays the position better than anyone has ever played it. He's unstoppable. He's one of the three best players in the league (with Watt and Rodgers). Over a career its Tony G, but in terms of outright ability, its Gronk. And by a big margin.
I was just waiting for this. Some teamsters somewhere are congratulating themselves.
Dude, if you have an attractive SO, let her show that shit off. You should take it as a compliment when other people want to fuck your girlfriend. If you really can't handle her style, then maybe she's not for you.
This is a question I ask myself all the fucking time. Truth is, I don't know, and it doesn't matter. I'm married to someone else, and we have a baby -- and that is a fucking amazing feeling every damn day.
For $200 you can do much better.
unfortunately stupid high grass density kills all other foliage
I hope not, I'm still getting a trickle of sweet, sweet karma for it. It's like a long term karma investment. It's like everyone else is prospecting for karma veins in the front page to get rich quick and I'm the guy selling them pickaxes and doritos.
Thats not true, we still have timeless gems like "What if Martin isn't Finn's dad?!" and "What if Susan is Finn's sister/mom/Fionna?" 
Haha, I lift all day, but my older sister is a ham.
I swallowed an arcade token when I was a kid. I don't ever remember shitting it out. That was over 30 years ago, I wonder if it's still in there.
Brady wasn't really the difference maker in any of our recent games. I'm interested in seeing how we do against the run. If we limit it, I'll be more confident.
I just now got it. Took me a full minute. And I'm a dad even. :( WP OP
Fleet Foxes are amazing, but FJM is on a different level. His songwriting is engaging and funny, and it's pretty clear that, despite the persona, he wholeheartedly believes in the music he makes.
Sounds like another Ron Paul situation.
Want some ice cream? How about *ripple*?
Is that a whole band or just the same bearded guy playing each instrument?
