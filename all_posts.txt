You just perfectly summed up both a game franchise and a game subreddit in one glorious post. Congratulations. Well done!My thought is that we go to Australia - which is the Devils Lair upside down. 
Very fucking well said my friend! 
It always seemed that in the past when I've made critical statements about Apple that I assumed would be popular and most Apple fans could see as a problem ... have been down voted to oblivion. 
What kind of degree did you get with no math classes? 
You're right.  BMI is the chart method.

I hate chocolate of all types, sweets always make me nauseous.
Yeah I don't see why so many people here are in denial about it.   Do what you want.   If weed makes you feel better,  great.   But don't pretend you're doing your lungs any favors in the process. 
Step 1: Start a business.Step 2: Don't fuck it up.
Yeah, I used to hate people who did this in code...I still can't bring myself to do it and ensure my code is readable and neat and tidy...

He might even be able to have that person ship it to him, although that may be a stretch i've heard of people attempt it before
Yeah that's better since they have the service history you can probably just call them with the vin over the phone.

Sounds fantastic. I'm totally jealous.
You're awesome, and don't deserve to feel blue.
WOOOOOO getting there quick too. It's going to fly by. Congrats! It's a major step. :D
I wish I could... This is my third nexus 6 in 3 months.

I went through a phase of doing that, right before the snapchat thing. Then I realized I needed a break. Since then I haven't done it as often- but coincidentally. Mainly life's just been intruding lately. 
That was not what i was expecting from reading the title.Anyways, sorry, losing pets sucks
Sounds nice! Lately i've really wanted to move to this town in England. Sounds stupid for an American to want to move there i know, but, gosh, this town is so pretty. From the pictures i want to move there and never come home.
So much ***giggity*** in your post and first line...
Oh thanks! I wasn't sure about /r/themall because I don't have an etsy shop (or interest in opening one). I'll post there too though, with your blessing. ;)I lub you guyz
I am literally jealous.  Grew up around welders, got to "play" with them a little bit.  I like my grown-up life, but man, I wish I was welding stuff.
The circus used to set up in my high school's parking lot every year.  Rumor has it that a clown knocked up a girl who went to school there.  Now the circus doesn't come around anymore.
Yeah, if I see that I'll cancel.
I'm pretty sure being dead would be considered in the 'unable to consent' territory of rape.
Pretty sure if rubbing alcohol could explode, I'd have managed it as a kid.  It can do a moderately energetic fireball if you boil it and have an open flame, but hey, so can regular old oil.

The fact that you think they are soulless knockoffs made without love is just plain wrong. Many of the games are made by small teams who do it for the love of the project, with little hope of actually making money off the game.

I had a kid because accidents happen, but there's a lot of fun in now having the ability to show someone Star Wars, Ghostbusters, Jaws, Jurassic Park, and The Beatles.    And that's pretty dope.

You're right. There's absolutely no evidence to suggest that PB is anything more than bisexual. There's also nothing to suggest that PB is outside the gender binary, either, so you really have nothing to apologize for. Your post was fine.

I like "Event Horizon", excellent set direction and use of color.  
Cool. Times change. I still like Hoax 4 and VG 8 style stuff the best.
Yeah but the inside of your egg will be cooked and won't come into contact with your other food while sitting on your counter/in your fridge.

&gt;These industry representatives have secured billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies to produce and market the very foods that make us sick.That sentence has a lot of what is wrong with America crammed into relatively few characters.

Well, I'm glad I haven't been on the internet long enough that I've become desensitized to things like that. That person is disgusting. He sounds like a fucking cartoon villain. How the hell do people like this exist?
The "perfect design" they are famous for died a few years ago with Steve Jobs. They have been making a lot of stang decisions lately that I don't think he would have signed off on.

Baby was not electrocuted, but I think we can all agree it was a dumbass thing to do and not recommended. Our parenting skills are an example of why there should be reproduction license tests. 
Not purely cosmetic.  Crowding can make it hard to brush or floss between teeth, which can lead to excess plaque.

For the USA, the mass incarceration of black men. There are a whole lot of ways to combat this like fighting against racism, but ending the war on drugs is the most effective way imo.

Dont' go upstairs, ALWAYS shoot the bad guy in the HEAD.  TWICE.  Don't go with the black guy if they split up.  I would probably die, but I'd lay some pain down first.

i agree with your assessment, in fact, I've sliced and diced the tracks to make a version where side one fades into Us and Them and carries on from there. Blasphemy, I'm sure, but whatever.

That's an interesting take.. I personally disagree though, rape is rape, I feel introducing grey areas to acts that are technically rape is a slippery slope

Can confirm. Purge does awesome narration and his videos are super helpful to watch. 
That's the general price for a custom last anywhere you go. Some places will build up a last for you for much cheaper, which is good enough for most people. Bespoke lasts truly are for people with foot issues or with lots of money.

Gronk plays the position better than anyone has ever played it. He's unstoppable. He's one of the three best players in the league (with Watt and Rodgers). Over a career its Tony G, but in terms of outright ability, its Gronk. And by a big margin.
I was just waiting for this. Some teamsters somewhere are congratulating themselves.
Dude, if you have an attractive SO, let her show that shit off. You should take it as a compliment when other people want to fuck your girlfriend. If you really can't handle her style, then maybe she's not for you.
This is a question I ask myself all the fucking time. Truth is, I don't know, and it doesn't matter. I'm married to someone else, and we have a baby -- and that is a fucking amazing feeling every damn day.

Fleet Foxes are amazing, but FJM is on a different level. His songwriting is engaging and funny, and it's pretty clear that, despite the persona, he wholeheartedly believes in the music he makes.

all I could think is, kidnapping and torture is something Mexicans deal with on a daily basis in a way most Americans can't understand. So I wonder how much of that is desensitization to their society's out-of-whack norms.

Yes I have held a newborn and I can tell you that it is not the second as pregnancy at all. For example, the baby is literally not inside the woman's body. That makes a huge difference when you are discussing the issue of women's bodies.
Yes, I bought it, I was already in the workforce and had lots of disposable income relative to my peers.  I wasn't rich, I simply didn't save any money.  ;)

No, they just have different views about what it means and what each relationship should look like. To say they don't understand marriage because they don't share your views on it is ridiculous.
Even if that is true, it's not a very good defense.
