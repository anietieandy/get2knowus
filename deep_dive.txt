My wife uses this work and every time I'm like, "WTF is that?!"I'm a dad, and I have 10% body fat.  That's a proper dad bod that your wife and children will respect.  I'm a dad.  When I want something (and there's money), I buy it.  This spring I bought myself a motorcycle.  I don't really even want to give my money to my wife and kid so they can buy me something I might not even want.I also got a wife and a baby. Partied like a rock star, now adulting like a pro
