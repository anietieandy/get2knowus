Just curious, about how many sessions and/or months did you talk to your therapist before this?  Also, is the therapist a gender specialist? (I'm a mom trying in midst of my son's transition.)
Mother's day isn't really a happy holiday for me, it will be one day when I'm a mommy though! 
I'm a mom- we worry : ) But yes, you will be fine. And can we say?  We are so proud of you!
That's is so sweet. I'm a mom, and I got teary eyed. I'm sure it means so much to her. 
I don't think it releases them. Shows her character though: I'm allowed to steal, cause I'm a mom with a small business.
They are trained from birth to use sunscreen.  I'm a mom of three of them and we buy it by the case.
It's like people think a certain status grants knowledge. I'm a mom, so now I know about nutrition! I'm old, so I know about how things ought to be! I'm successful, so I know how YOU can be successful!
I'm a mom and I've had the cops called on me because my daughter was shrieking bloody murder outside the car... after she tried to beat the shit out of her sister.  Obviously trying to prevent violence warrants police intervention.
I'm a mom so when I saw full frontal women and men in front of my daughter who asked if  sex is "when privates only touch" I didn't really get too much into the storyline
Oh, uh...That's what we call it at my house when I'm Murfy and my fiance/ daughter are the other characters. (Because I'm a mom and I regularly save their asses)
My mom does this all the time. And now that I'm a mom, I do this all the time.
My life goal is to embarrass my daughter (and now her boyfriend too!)  I'm a mom, but her dad is no longer with us.  SOMEONE has to embarrass the kid.
Yup, I'm a mom and that's exactly where I go. 
Meh. I'm a mom. Doesn't freak me out. 
I'm a mom w/2 boys raising NASCAR and hockey fans!  Remember to kiss your mamas tomorrow!!! Happy mother's day to all the mothers watching the race tonight!!!Edit: and kiss your daddys too for helping us raise you! 
I was in my pj's at home :) I'm a mom, so I don't think it's appropriate to show my stomach in public. Only sometimes when I go to sleep.
"His name is Danny.  He was named after his mother.""I'm a mom???"
Hey hey, I'm a mom member of both and I still think it's funny! My little guy will be 1 on Tuesday and he has face planted more times than I can count. 
This is what I do. I usually just scoop whatever I think I'll need into one of those little snack bags. But I'm a mom and have a huge purse. I've brought it just that way into music festivals and everything and no one has ever said anything about it.
I hope you're eating vegetables too. (Sorry, I'm a mom.)
I'm a mom and I wish I could do this stuff with my son.    I don't know how to snowboard, I'd probably maim us both ):
Maybe it depends what modest means. I guess I just want the freedom to control my wardrobe. I'm a mom, I'm not going to be doing anything too crazy. :) 
Damn straight.. I'm a mom, who has time for this crap?
I'm a mom that plays with her first grader.   Is this something for us (not being techy) or should I just ignore.
I'm a mom, drive a truck and use my signal at all correct times. 
I'm a mom too. I'm so proud of you! well done and my best wishes to you and your family. 
I'm a mom. I mod /r/parentsofmultiples and /r/TalesFromRetail and would love to help mod /r/mothersday
I totally second this! I'm a mom to 3... I feel ya, I totally feel ya. 
(Put a serious tag on this.) No worries. They probably don't care. Almost everybody masturbates. I'm a mom, and if my younger one told me they found the older one masturbating, I'd tell them that's private and he shouldn't share that with others.
I'm a mom. I say clean her house or take her out to dinner.
I can't imagine how you all must feel. I'm a mom too so my heart breaks for you. 
That's what I was thinking. But I don't want any of that stale stink. I rarely smoke, I'm a mom. Lol. I just need a freakin break.
2 camping chairs, sunscreen, bug spray, high heel shoes, and scrabble (the board game).Edit: I'm a mom, I'm fair skinned, I hate mosquitos, sometimes I get a night off from being mom, and I'm always down for scrabble (who isn't). 
I'm with you. I'm a mom of 3 girls and I want to rip his man titties off and beat him with them. 
I'm a mom, with a full-time job and I'm a full-time student. Some days I feel like I'm doing a horrible job at all 3 of those things but for the most part the plates stay spinning. 
Because I said so.Source: I'm a mom.
Well, see, I'm a mom like...well, that mom that will bring the potluck to church, but also drinks whiskey over poker, and knows what a Hot Carl is. She's not a cool mom, but she knows what's up.
Head boops from my cats, when babies and small children smile or wave at me (I'm a mom, it's not creepy for me to like that), wild bunnies in my yard, seeing kids who obviously dressed themselves.
I'm a mom...we can really fuck up some shit for sure. 
It's fine l I'm a mom of three so I get ignored by a whole lot of people sometimes and it's gotten to a point where it just ticks me off immediately and disproportionately hugely.
I studied solar energy in college waaay back in the 70's, and live in a solar-powered house. Also I'm a mom :-/
I just thought it would be fun to read a couple of these at the shower. I'm a mom. I know about too much advice.
No, no they do not.  If someone ran for president with the stump speech: "I can run the country!  I'm a mommy!" I'd work faster on my shuttle to Mars.
I'm a mom with three teenagers - please, please tell her and then talk to the police! Even if something doesn't happen, that's an awful lot to have on your shoulders by yourself.
I honestly thought he was working up to getting her number. "I'm a mom of 2 kids"*he won't*
We went out to eat today for my MIL today and my BIL gave me flowers. My first response was, why? Then I remembered I'm a mom too 
next time I visit mom and she tries to make me go to church i'll put Holy Ghost onAnd then go to church with her anyway cause it makes her happy and I'm a momma's boy
I was just thinking this. I also was Rory's age when it first started and now I'm a mom and I so agree with you. 
I'm a mom. I used to be an enabling mom. This is going to make huge issues with you and you GF if she doesn't agree. Good luck. Breaking bad habits in kids is hard. Hard on all involved. I wish you only luck.EDIT: 
Haha! Now that I'm a mom I talk about poop way more than I ever did before!
I'm a mom and my body looks like that! MUUAHAHAHA Suck it fatties!!
I'm a mom.[This is my "mum bod."](http://imgur.com/66unFu7) - my tattoo is blurred out.I'm offended by the term "mum bod." 
I'm a mom and this breaks my heart. You don't deserve to be treated this way, especially not by a person who should be your biggest champion. As soon as you can, I'd move far, far away from such a soul-sucking person. 
Regarding your edit. I'm a mom. Don't worry about the time, go home and be safe. That man is a sick maniac. 
I'm a mom and I would never allow my daughter or son to do this either. I know it kind of sucks right now but soon enough you'll be an adult and you can make your own choices. 
I'm a mom with a 6 month old who really doesn't want a soccer mom car haha. So I have to find the balance of practical and fun. This will be my actual sleeper mom car. 
PS.  I forgot to be offended that you assume I'm a Cougar because I'm a mom.  There's lots of young moms :-)  
I'm a mommy to a beautiful 18 month old baby human female. Thank you!!! ðŸŒºðŸŒºðŸŒºðŸŒº
I'm a mom. We're stronger than you think. Most of us older generation have also experienced sexual assault. Your mother is there to help you. 
"So what if it gets 3 miles to the gallon? I'm a mom, not a conservationist!"
I feel this way, too. I've also gotten snarky comments because I'm a mom, so obviously I'm neglecting my kids to look pretty.  
Ugh that's gross. And I'm a mom with a toddler. 
Because if she made it to top 3 and didnt win fans would rage. And I don't think its her season to win. I honestly think its Violet's or even Ginger's. I'm a mom lover and hope you're right. But my gut tells me otherwise. 
The jeans that say "I'm not a woman anymore, I'm a mom!"
Well, y'all know I'm a mom :3 that's good enough indication 
What a beautiful offer! I'm a mom and would love a card! Pming address and thank you so much :)
I see nothing wrong with it.  I'm a mom.
I'm a mom, I do this. Don't act like there's no reason. You had 8 hours to do 30 minutes worth of work.
That I'm a mom. I'm only 20 and if I'm not with her, people would have no idea that I had a child.
I'm a mom and I don't play video games, but I did enjoy watching my son play. It wasn't something I grew up doing and I don't have the dexterity for it. 
I'm a mom, but I agree, I would be a *great* dad.  :PMy first ultrasound picture of her just looked a bean. She was so tiny when she was born and so I guess calling her my little Charlie bean just stuck. So yes. What about yours?
Next time she says "come to mommy" smile and pass the baby back to your sister. I'm a mom and I would flip my shit if someone said that to one of my kids.
Thank you for the Mother's Day wishes!!I hate that it's always about Nmom, she's been a lousy mom, why must we celebrate that?  I'm a mom too and my kids actually LIKE me. 
I'm a mommas boy. My twin brother and I never met our biological father. My mom is single now if you want me to share? Lol. Just kidding. Sorry for your loss. Idk what I'd do without my mom.
It would be the same way here too. I'm a mom too, I understand completely. Luckily mine are only 3 years old so a while before they leave home.
