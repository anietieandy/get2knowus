Wait. I like drinking. I'm a dad. Eagles are favorite team. Well shit.
I want an e63 amg wagon when I'm a dad. 
I feel you.  I used to never cry at things I was supposed to cry at. At most, I got a little misty seeing the end of Les Miserables on stage for the first time.Now that I'm a dad, I'm a damn lawn sprinkler.
What are dad jeans? I'm a dad, I wear jeans... So are all my jeans dad-jeans?
I'm a dad, the stranger danger thing was replaced, or so I've been told. My daughter was taught in school that strangers are okay if they're mom's. "find a mommy and tell her you need help". Because dad's are fucking criminals? 
Sorry for your loss. I'm a daddy of a 2 1/2 yo and I can't imagine what you went/are going through. I'm glad there is at least a silver lining.
My biggest turnoff is when women call their men daddy. I'm a dad, and that would make me limp so fast
Thanks for the insight! I just liked the idea of taking a mundane fuck up and making it funny. Also I'm a dad in training.
I'm a dad and former teen.  Can confirm.  
Fan-fucking-tastic. That dad should chill the fuck out. Source: I'm a dad. 
I just now got it. Took me a full minute. And I'm a dad even. :( WP OP
Play him some Royal Blood or Black Keys. Also perhaps the Decemberists.I'm a dad with serious classic rock roots. Though I never stopped looking for and enjoying new bands, those are some bands I play for my dadrock-obsessed friends.
I'm a dad and I read The Road when my son was 3.  I think I might have traumatized him with 7 hours of hugs and kisses when I finished that book.
I'm a dad and I'm going to use this
As a guy with an awesome 3 year old daughter... I still couldn't agree more. Yes, the awesome part is my opinion. I'm a dad, get over it.
Thank you, you've encouraged me to keep trying. Maybe I just have to wait until I'm a dad for it to work.
the guy playing Xbox will be me when I'm a dad... (but it will be a PC)
That typeface has that Impact on people. Yes, I'm a dad. 
I'm a dad... Black tank top, khaki shorts, black flip flops and sunglasses... Close enough. I did grill though.
I'm a dad and still in no way shape or form lol kids always surprise you. Dad instincts however are real! I know from experience 
I'm a dad...can confirm this sort of thing happens on a near daily basis at my house.   Sometimes you catch them, sometimes you don't.  
I'm a dad with 3 girls, 1 boy. There's insanity, stress, and anyone that tells you kids are great is lying. I love my kids, but don't have them. They'll take your soul and all of your disposable income.
Maybe when I'm a dad and I wear a cell phone holster. I'm still 28
"I'm a daddy bear".
Of course not. But your risk here is really high. Possible legal issues, parents killing you, people destroying property. let alone breaking your parents' trust.Then again, I'm a dad, so I might tend to err on the cautious side. ;)
Tucked in is *I'm a dad and don't care what I'm wearing as long as it covers my body*.
&gt; Tucked in is I'm a dad and don't care what I'm wearing as long as it covers my body.. . . and makes me look like I still care about basic rules of fashion and dignity. Finished that for you
I'm a dad as well and started losing weight when my daughter was born. Seems weird that I want to be there for her but I was just killing my body with food. Just started eating less. Gym had nothing to do with it.
I'm a dad, this happened to me with my second kid.  It will get better, or at least it did for me.  My youngest is almost 3, and I've bonded incredibly with them both.  I still get happy to go to work on Monday morning.
Just wanted to say I'm a dad and I love NIN too! Trained my 2yo to say "Yeah Nine Inch Nails!" every time Pandora plays them. 
Awesome man! And congrats on the kid dude! I'm a dad too! Dad's are my favorite gamers! 
Subs this thread... I'm a dad too. This camera experience sucks
I think it's what's known as a 'thing' of the moment.I'm a dad and I make shitty jokes like this all the time, just like my dad did and his dad before that. History is filled with dads making crap jokes based on....erm...words?
I'm a dad. It could happen to you.
Yea I'm a dad and seeing him slide down a rail over stairs with her made my skin crawl. Very cool and I'm sure that little girl loved it but it's an unnecessary risk if you ask me. 
I'm a dad. Does that mean I have a dad bod Greg? 
Never be sorry for questions.  I'm a dad anyway, so [I can handle it](http://i.imgur.com/wVrgmIo.gif). This is what I used last time I stripped something  http://i.imgur.com/htXlLej.jpg
I'm a daddy, will I do?
I'm a dad and will be 40 this year.  Does that count?
Twohundredsixtyfivethousandthreehundredfiftynine times? You must have really sticky poo. Ate too much pi, maybe?    (Yes, I'm a dad, ánd I'll see myself out.)
Holy fuck I'm going to do this when I'm a dad. 
Meh, who gives a shit? I'm a dad, if my kids did that then I would just assume they were doing something better than hanging around me.
At this point, yes. I mean I work for a small company and have been there longer than most people. A lot of my coworkers are right around my age... And since I'm a dad now, I don't really have much of a social life outside of work.
I'm in Arkansas, and I'm a dad.
Just call it the Alec Baldwin show for my money. So many good quotes.&lt;In Jack's whiskey voice&gt;"You see Liz, I'm a bear. And I'm a daddy. I'm a daddy bear".
Exactly. The fact that she accepted, kinda proves she wasn't a fit mother. I would die before handing my kids over, and I'm a dad. 
I'm a dad but I'll never tell them that their mother is a cunt, they can figure that out on their own.
I'm a dad. This just kills me. Call him. 
Yeah. I'm a dad and I hate it when people say I'm baby sitting. They're *my* kids.
I'm sorry about your Neice. I'm a dad of two little ones. I can't imagine what your brother/sister is going through. 
Now that I'm a dad all the damn time......
Just watch your back for the dad toting a baseball bat and swinging for the fences. (Source: I'm a dad)
I'm sorry about your Neice. I'm a dad of two little ones. I can't imagine what your brother/sister is going through. 
Knock knockWho's there?AppleOh, Hi Apple, come on in!I'm a dad and like spoiling my young kids' knock knock jokes.
Well, I'm a dad, and I hope I'm qualified to answer your mom question. I will not tell my daughter that her mom doesn't like her name.
I'm a dad with two girls and I rarely even let them see me in underwear, let alone naked. I just don't like it. My dad would run around naked in the house *all the time* and it *always* made me uncomfortable. 
I'm a dad, but thanks for the reassurance and encouragement!
I'm really sad for you and your dad. I'm a daddy's girl and he taught me not to take shit regardless of their sex. I hope you and your dad can be closer as adults since nameless can be thrown out if he's willing.
im a papaya I'm a papaya I'm a papaya, look at me move!!!
I have no idea, but it's the first thing that came to mind. Yes, I'm a dad. I'm trapped in Nick Jr. (Please send help.)
Hey guy, I'm a dad of three and play same as you, once the house is quiet and everyone's in bed. Add me, currently making my way through far cry4, psn Is: gagnonspecial I'll add you.
Not to little kids that will beg for anything that is a new Spider-man. Source: I'm a dad^who^also^buys^many^mini-figures.
I'm a dad and I listen to Merzbow. Does that mean Merzbow is dad rock?
Its actually super complex, but they only used white ink when they printed it. Source: I'm a dad. 
**Nah** but when I'm a dad I'm gonna be sik ass 90s boy dad and embarrass my children with kool dad jokes. 
I like it. I'm a dad, and I wear polos. Looks like a good fit for me ;-)
Man, I'm a dad and a lot of my friends are dads too. We're getting to the age when our kids are aware, but still can't spell, ie toddlers. When we spell things out, I always say SEX CAULDRON???!! 
His last Comedy special was "I have a daughter. Let me tell you about my kid. I'm a dad. Did you know I'm a parent? Having kids is tough. I'm a dad. I have a daughter"I think he tossed like 2 jokes into an hour long bit
And take the definition off their arms and abs. Socks and sandals.This hurts the most because I'm a dad haha
*I approach because I'm a dad too and I'm now physically incapable of ignoring the presence of a kid.* Heh, havin' there pops?
I'm a dad; I'll give you $65. C'mon, man— help me out.
I would never in a million years bring a baby to a movie theatre. (Source:I'm a dad) If you want to see a film that bad find a babysitter for the 3 hours you will be gone or.. Hmmmm...let's see check your maturity level and wait for it to rent or buy.
Can we not let "dadbod" be a thing?  I'm a dad of three and my dadbod is never going to cause roll down of underwear.
I'm a dad. I have a 6 year old. All i ask is that he spends the day with me on fathers day. I dont have physical custody,  so to me its a big deal. 
Saxual HealingIt's ok I'm a dad.
Whenever I'm a dad and my kid/kids won't go to bed when they're supposed to, I'm totally gonna use this line on them.
I'm a dad. 6'1", 170 lbs. No beer belly here. I can tell you 100% that fat girls like dad bods the way undocumented immigrants love rusted pickup trucks. If they could do better, they would. 
Fuck this dadbod movement. I'm a dad and I won't be caught dead looking like that.
I'm a dad who has priorities and responsibilities and still manages to stay in shape. I like being someone my son can physically respect, and remain attractive for my wife. It's fun being the only ripped guy at PTA meetings. Fuck those lazy fat shits.
When I'm a dad I want to have the heart of Stannis Baratheon and the complete gooberness of Mace Tyrell
Listen to the wife. edit: I'm a dad to 3
I'm so glad someone posted this. I love my son, there's no doubt of that, but I miss being alone with my wife, having spare time to play games, spare money to buy parts for my motorcycle... But hey, I'm a dad now... So.. Ya know... Yay? 
What system?  I'm a dad and am coming back after a 3 month hiatus. I was a daily player and almost fear I will be again based on how much seems to be added (based in reddit comments). 
I'm a dad, can testify. Our dicks are huge.
Which is really sad. I'm a dad and I hate it when people think women have some magical parent powers that men don't.
I'm a dad, The sub was made for discussing things, it has devolved into people posting pictures of their kids for easy karma.
I'm a dad.  I knew *immediately* what was going to happen.  I got nauseous within the first *half-second* of this clip.
I'm a dad, and I have 10% body fat.  That's a proper dad bod that your wife and children will respect.  
Really glad you made the trip. I'm a dad of daughters, and I hope when we hit this age they'll still want to take a trip to WDW with me.
I'm a dad.  When I want something (and there's money), I buy it.  This spring I bought myself a motorcycle.  I don't really even want to give my money to my wife and kid so they can buy me something I might not even want.
Damn, now i know what to do when I'm a dad if my kid ever fucks up this bad, this shit is great
I love how he's just like "Yeah, I'm a dad, I understand."
Oh god that's cute! I can't wait until I'm a dad
Hey, I'm Joshua.Welcome to the sub! Hope to see you around and get to know you.I'm a dad. My wife lurks around here sometimes but hasn't been as active lately. Kids are fun though... one of mine is in her "Threenager" stage. ^Send ^^help
Seriously.  Is watching TV all you do with your kid?  A movie should be a treat, not a daily activity.And yes, I'm a dad and know how hard it is to keep kids interested. 
A healthy grownup can take being screamed at by their kid. Source: I'm a dad. And knowing the context, a healthy grownup isn't going to take your screaming at them personally, and won't put any guilt on you about it.
