I'm a teacher and it's not that we're dumb, it's that dumb people make policies that we HAVE to follow. The people in charge of the education system usually have no fucking clue what they're doing and just make it harder on us to be effective teachers. 
I'm a teacher and summer is coming soon. I'd have time to play a new game! Good luck making your choice. Nice thing of you to do. 
That's my thing, I'm a teacher and I have 4 tattoos, most of which no one at work has ever seen. 
This was a substitute. I'm a teacher. I've been trained to deal with kids like this. I've had MANY inservices on de-escalation techniques. He did basically everything wrong. 
I'm a teacher now, we had parachute day last month. A kid threw up on it just as it was going up! Never again will I have parachute day!!!!
It definitely isn't ethical, even if it isn't illegal. I NEVER take pictures of my students on my phone. I just don't want to go there.Edit: I'm a teacher and it's Friday. Redditing and beer don't mix
Where the hell are the teachers? Are all Yankee schools like this (genuine question)? I'm a teacher and there are always teachers on duty. Especially indoors where there are tonnes of pubescent assholes crowded together. 
&gt;I'm a teacher and I wouldn't treat my students this way.Their neither your teachers nor your students. They're your peers and sometimes people just don't like other people. It doesn't mean you get to be a part of their social circle. 
No, I know enough and have been told by other places, that I am doing well enough and not spazzing. I'm too technical.. I AM a special snowflake. Haha. I'm a teacher and I wouldn't treat my students this way. 
You would be surprised I'm a teacher now so I don't see as many kids but when I was a sub such a huge population of students had stupid names I never heard people making fun of others names, It was maybe one out of every 3 kids had a traditional name.
Kobe. Because I'm a teacher and that's what every kid screams from across the room when they're trash-ket-balling.
Tell me about it, I'm a teacher and these kids are born in the 2000s
I'm a teacher, I have a contract, I can be fired still for practically any reason.  And let's not pretend the NFL has to honor player contracts, lol.
How much history do you have in it? I'm a teacher and I've been integrating TTRPGs into lessons to great success, and I happen to be about to do WWII. If it has some history in it, I might try it out for the class. 
I'm so late to this, but I'm really interested. I love games (board, computer, anything really) and I'm a teacher. How do I become you someday? I don't want to start over in undergrad (majored in English Ed), but wish I could.
Was it more important that your sons receive good grades or develop into decent adults throughout school?Our do you value those things together? I'm a teacher, and schooooooool's (almost) out for summer.
No worries padawan. keep the questions coming if you want, I'm a teacher at heart and it's like my favorite thing to talk about stuff I'm excited about. 
I'm a teacher and have to escort a bunch of teenagers to this very same park after a competition every year. I used to like roller coasters. Now I'll maybe get on the train. Mostly though I try to sleep in one of the theaters. 
I'm a teacher, and that was a joke. Looks like you need to brush up on a little L.K.2.
Infj here. I'm a teacher. Not glamorous or high paying, but it suits me pretty well.
&gt;I'm a teacher at a quasi-military residential academyA what?
Well, since I'm a teacher I currently have next week off so any time works for me.  Which season kit would you like? What size will you need? Feel free to PM me details as needed.
I'm a teacher and I'd happily take any Lego off your hands for the cost of shipping. I'm trying to start a Lego club at our school and use them in math/STEM activities already. 
I'm a teacher.Dumb may not be the best word. Unwise, though...
This concept doesn't exist where I live (Brazil), and people are shocked when they hear about it.  A lot of them repeat the story to their classes (I'm a teacher).
I'm a teacher and I'm going to put this sign in my classroom next year.
Not sure what part of the US you're from... I'm a teacher in Massachusetts (Second Grade, which is 7 and 8 year olds) and even my lowest struggling readers could read that letter. 
I'm a teacher, which means I can't afford gold, but if I had it I'd give it to you for this comment. All the gold.
I LOVE seeing good dads!! I'm a teacher and it's ridiculous how many dads aren't the picture!! :-/
Haha thanks for the kind words. I'm a teacher, so I do detailing on the side and during the summer for some extra cash flow. Black does look amazing when done right though, so thanks for the sentiments. :)
Sometimes, it's little kids (I'm a teacher) so I use my teacher voice to say, "Oh, we say that someone like me is tall, not big!" But I still get the occasional adult that says it. They get the less-friendly, "No, I'm tall." 
I'm a teacher. I try not to hold mine while teaching. It's one of those life skills that is acquired over time. 
I'm a teacher and only have time to game on breaks. With summer coming up I'm getting ready to binge play! I've already got FFx &amp; X-2 remastered on my list, anything else you'd recommend?
I'm a teacher and can tell you that after grading for hours your temper is growing thin. If it was a final project and you out a video of MP I would either find it hilarious or horrifying, no middle ground. Good luck with your teacher!
I'm a teacher as well and was taught bikram is great but designed for people 25 and younger. The heat is not for everyone and it is easy to injure yourself.  Listen to your body.  If it hurts why push it further? 
Actually I get by fine on 40 since I'm a teacher and only have to work half the year I find 40 pretty fair 
I'm a teacher and I watched it at my classroom, no fucks given :3
I'm a teacher and I see plenty of kids with iPod touches. Storage for music is really secondary concern for them. They use it for games, social media, and messaging through apps like Kik and WhatsApp.
I'm a teacher, so "The 7 Habits" is a way for me to refocus when shit has gone sideways 
See, I love kids (I'm a teacher). At the time of reading I had just finished nannying a kid who displayed similar behaviour to Kevin at that age.  That was creepy. 
As I Lay Dying is amazing. I'm paraphrasing from memory, but one of my favorite lines is from Addie: "after school was over, I would walk down to the creek where I could be quiet and hate them." She was talking about her students. I'm a teacher. 
I reread Darth Plagueis by James Luceno because of how he justifies his evil. I'm a teacher so it helps me understand administrators and parents. There really are people who want to watch the whole world burn.
Going through my old papers for this year I found it buried in a stack. I'm a teacher. Shit gets lost sometimes. 
It's pretty common in a lot of industries. I'm a teacher but I also teach this in financial maths as part of the syllabus to students in year 11 because it's so common.
It's funny because I'm a teacher and I do the same thing at the end of the year. "...Mr...what are we learning today?""...uh...?"
I live in Texas and I'm a teacher and a girl and I love you in that tank.
I'm a teacher.I'm more horrified he took images of children's faces and uploaded them online. 
I think that's true.Source: I'm a teacher, we were told to use comic sans in our powerpoints for dyslexic kids. Also, pale background
Dude, I'm a teacher, I wish more people brought baby ducks!
I'm a teacher.. I smoke every single morning on my way to work. It makes me much happier, focused, and out-going. Is my job just a 9-5 and not professional enough for you?
I could do that in two weeks? I'm a teacher so I'll have more time once school lets out. Pm me
Yes, we understand of course, but yes, incorrect if you just want to say "I'm a teacher".  There are cases where it is correct though, for instance : "Je suis un professeur qui aime son travail" 
I'm a teacher. When I have interviews, they always ask me if I have a degree. However, they never ask what it's in or what grade I got. I could have gotten a 3rd in Underwater Basket Weaving and they'd be cool with it. 
I'm a teacher so I understand the importance of pens! It makes the different between offering well thought out commentary on an essay versus just scribbling a grade on it and moving on 
Do you think that five years of experience is enough to start teaching guitar? I'm in highschool and could use a summer job. I'm a teacher in my schools guitar club, and I am told that I'm pretty good. Thanks in advance!
Did you try threatening to sue because that just sounds all types of illegal. I'm a teacher and was told if I have maternity leave before December they will do an involuntary transfer. 
I'm a teacher and I collect a lot of videogame paraphernalia. Some I even take to work (Pok√©mon World Championship 2014 Lanyard and Club Nintendo Majora's Mask bag)
I'm a teacher, and I can just imagine the looks on my learners' faces! Hahaha Ichigo-stance included and everything!
This is exactly what happened. I'm a teacher. You'd think that sweaters sprouted from the ground.
I'm a teacher,  and If this game science based accurate and the photography option gets in.. I could use it at school. Children would love it!
Soremade (time's up)I'm a teacher and after studying Judo for a little bit, I just started thinking it at the end of class or tests.  Finally I just started saying it.  Now it's pretty much my signature phrase.
I'm a teacher, on my feet all day. Between my morning workout and work, I'm usually around 15k by 3pm. 
I'm a teacher and can't spell to save my life. I usually go with the "messy hand writing" cover up. That or have students write on the board. 
This is the single most quotable film I think I have ever seen. I'm a teacher, and since watching it I think I've lost count of how many times I've told students "my time is like a toddler in a tiara, short and precious." 
I'm a teacher...there are many acronyms. I boycott them. 
I'm a teacher, but I get paid less than standard entry level teacher salary, long story behind that. I also have a sizeable hecs debt which comes out of my salary so I'm left with very little to play around with at the end of the month. 
This place is swarmed with school kiddies and they get all giggly over words like that. I'm a teacher so I'm used to it. I never read anything as a class with such words  ... even a simple word like "balls," they just can't handle it.
I'm a teacher- please let me be retired before that shit storm comes into my classroom- not so much dreading the kid as I am the phone calls from that mom.
I'm a teacher. For two years, I had an aide like this. Two years of my life I can't get back.
&gt;I'm a teacher. For two years, I had an aide like this. Two years of my life I can't get back.In this context, that might come off differently than you planned.
I'm a teacher of older kids. This is why. I would lose it. Good on him for stopping.
I'm a teacher here, they're definitely better behaved. But they aren't angels. Google Kancho.
I'm a teacher and If I have anything wrong with my stomach - it's an automatic call-out. I teach music and teach back to back classes with no break. I feel your pain! Hope you feel better soon!! Lot's of water!
I'm at like $48 now. It depends on a few factors. I'm a teacher so I get education related questions now, which expands it quite a bit.
Me, already drunk. I'm a teacher, so Bill Nye videos all day tomorrow. 
I'm a teacher now, I have a teen who's a big sox fan, we mess with each other daily.
I'm a teacher's assistant while I'm in a grad program and I got a shit load of e-mails today AND I have to come up with test questions for the lecture I did last week.I don't want to be in academia anymore :(
Social psychology to undergrads. I'm a teacher's assistant and the professor is out so I'm filling in today.
Are you in education? I also attract many teachers and social workers. I assume it is because I'm a teacher
Ugh, I HAD to take one. A) I'm a teacher, and it's the end of the year; B), I'm in life limbo moving back to my home state and waiting to see where I will be teaching next. Trying not to go crazy!
I can't decide if I'm a teacher who also happens to be an amateur comedian, or I'm an amateur comedian who also happens to be a teacher.
Well, I'm a teacher and we say it everyday.  I just leave out that part.  
I'm a teacher. We do this to keep students from going to sleep.
I did not know they were crustaceans! I'm a teacher, and those would make for a good animal to observe!
This is super cute! I'm a teacher, and really appreciate when people can do amazing things with art! Way to go!!!
I'm a teacher and a couple of weeks ago, two girls were doing this exact thing in the back of the room.
I'm a teacher, married to another teacher.  We just give the cat the flavors we don't like to eat ourselves.
I'm a teacher in India, and the summer vacation starts 19th May and lasts at least 3 weeks. I don't see the option for that in the poll.
Yes, Games the Shop. I probably won't play on launch immediately either. Need to finish W2 to import that save game. Where are you from, by the way?I'm a teacher in Calcutta, and my summer vacation starts from 20th. Muhahahaha.
I'm a teacher. Every one of those things are taught at some point in my student's high school career.
Fuck this kid. I'm a teacher and I'm completely willing to lose my job over some fucktard acting like this. I spend my time and money to educate you halfwits and this is how you act? Fuck you, come get some then.
I'm a teacher now. So I guess I found another career path where I'm still giving people information. But yes, a small part of me still wants to be a news reporter like Jeff Gianola. 
*Sanford stops once the lightning is gone.* "You put off enough energy to burn a hole in this thing, it's a rental, and I'm a teacher."
San: "I'm a teacher, but I also have my hobbies."Sieg: "I'm about to teach history, but that's because I need a way to relax."
"I'm sorry, what does being a guy have to do with anything? I'm a teacher. THAT'S why I want to teach."
Haha and thanks.  I'm a teacher and my students told me they know I'm old because I snowboard, so you are hip again.  
Just depends on who you work for and what state you are in. I'm a teacher in NC, and work in the public school system,  which means I'm on the State Health Plan for Employees. Preferred strips &amp; lancets are $10 a month. Insulin is $60, I think. 
I'm a teacher and since I left TSCC, I have problems saying the Pledge of Allegiance every morning
I'm a teacher and it creeps me out to say the pledge every morning with the entire school. 
I like it. It's like taking a course on magic products. Although, I'm a teacher so I'm a little biasedEdit: I had to fix my error. I said I wouldn't, but it was killing me
Everyone's entitled to an education. I'm a teacher.Am I a slave?No.
&gt;Everyone's entitled to an education. I'm a teacher.&gt;Am I a slave?&gt;No.And what if hypothetically everyone chose to stop being a teacher tomorrow.  Do the people through the government have the right to force you to re-enter the profession?
I get that shit because I'm a teacher. "Oh, you get the whole summer off." Go fuck yourself, my job isn't any easier than yours.
Where do you go to school, where wearing a hat is 'crazy'? I'm a teacher and I wear a hat, and I'm about the only one in the whole school. I'm proud of my damn hat, although I get a lot of shit from my students about it.
Work. I'm a teacher and it's almost summer. 
I'm a teacher. I have a large sample size that show that your shittiness and awesomeness are independent of your opinion of yourself. 
You have to get good at the straight face response! Now that I'm a teacher, some kids will ask if there is a "baby in my belly". While mildly embarrassing it makes for a good time to remind them that all people come in different shapes and sizes. 
I get in for free because I'm a teacher. In fact there's a ton of places that will let teachers in for free, because they hope they're bring school excursions there.
It is!!!  I'm a teacher now and I get to decide how often we make ooblek, it's a great life!!!!  Lol. 
I'm a teacher who is slightly weird myself.  there are groups everywhere.  While they may not fit in now, know that they have a great parent(s) who cares about them, and they'll find people who will fit in great alongside them.
Lol, I'm a teacher and I say this to my students all the time. They usually just stare at me, looking all dumbfounded until I bark at them to get back to work!
Shit I'm a teacher and I've never done this. I must be terrible at my job or something.
I'm a teacher. I find it really taxing.
Autism? I'm a teachers assistant at a school for that population and this isn't unheard of. Some parents have harnesses to keep the kids from getting up after they've been buckled in
I'm a teacher. I have to buy my own tissue boxes. Bring your own tissues! 
Reading to my kids. I'm a teacher, after spending my day reading to my students I've had enough by the time I get home. Reading 7466466 bedtime stories just feels like work.
I'm a teacher who went through a similar thing, although mine was done before I really got into school. He appreciated the hell out of that. If he didn't at the time, he does now. You helped a great deal. 
There are still tons of latchkey kids. I'm a teacher in a suburb in the Midwest and I'd guess that 1/4 of my students are.
I'm a teacher here. I love having a way to make color prints for materials.
I felt like a badass at the time. I wasn't the kind of kid you wanted to be on the wrong side of, if you were a teacher.Now I'm regretting it... I'm a teacher.
Children, I'm gay.I'm a teacher in a Catholic school..not the kind of Catholic school that actually listens to what the Pope says.
That everyone is equal and can do anything they want with their lives.... I'm a teacher. 
I'm a teacher and in pretty sure I've done half these things... I call my students idiots, they call me an idiot... Then we learn things...
Freedom of choice- to work in such a way that I am fulfilled, but not overworked and exhausted and strapped for both cash and energy&gt;I'm a teacher.
I'm a teacher and I swear, "game developer" is the new "pro football/basketball/baseball player" dream job of teen boys. It's fine, but it makes me laugh because I imagine they think it means playing video games all day. 
"Can I go to the bathroom?"I'm a teacher
I'm a teacher too, I agree with you. I've seen both cases, could be either.
When I became responsible for a bunch of 16 year olds. I'm a teacher. Other than that, I really thought I'd have my life together by this point. I really thought I would feel like an adult. Nope. I'm still just winging it and hoping for the best.
A lot of teachers are idiots and have very little grasp of real world realities. (I'm a teacher now, I despise most of my peers)
Because fuck privacy, I'm a teacher damnit!
I'm a teacher at a Catholic private school and I'm pretty atheist. I'm too lazy to look for another job.
We had a 3 hour power outage the other day, during school hours (I'm a teacher). 3 hours with 26 10-year-olds in a classroom was harder than it sounds...
Thanks, I'm a teacher, if you want an interview PM me your resume and I can hook you up with an interview, or if you just want advice, I'd be happy to share.
I'm a teacher. If you have a child, be active in their lives and their learning.
I'm a teacher, my students are allergic to EVERYTHING. A mom sent in 24 red velvet cupcakes for a birthday party and I sent them all back untouched. I am the monster we all hated as children.
My ex joked that if we have drinks called "kamakazis" or "Irish car bombs" there should be one called "the Sandy Hook". I'm a teacher.
I went to three proms in high school so I'm going to answer this differently.I'm a teacher and I regret not going to the senior prom this year. I feel like I let down my kids. :(
I'm a teacher. I get paid my same salary throughout the summer even when I'm not working. Yes, being salaried is great. However, if I could find a job where I made $100/hour after taxes, etc., I'm jump at the chance. 
I know you're not giving out gold anymore, but thought I'd share anyway: I'm a teacher.
Cum folderI'm a teacher. It's short for "cumulative" folder.  Makes me shudder each time I go to the office for records. 
Career day...now I'm a teacher...
I am living with my parents while finding a new place. I'm a teacher so I deal with kids all day. I love my job but goddamit when I get home I just need time to not talk to anyone or even think.My mother doesn't understand this.
&gt;You're spouting off opinion only without backing it up with facts whatsoever. I'm a teacher, which I guess in your mind makes me an imbecile, but you go ahead and keep doing what you're doing. 
Access to museums. I'm a teacher. Free passes!
I'm a teacher as well and I was just thinking that it's been years since I've had to speak to someone about saying, "That's so gay."
I'm a teacher with nine days left in the school year.Took an absence, drank cheap wine all day, played video games.
Canada here,  I'd go to Sweden or Finland for 2nd citizenship.  They both have really awesome education systems (I'm a teacher) and are beautiful places in general.  
Like I said in another comment, I'm a teacher and not only did I experience this firsthand with a colleague, there is a serious push in academia to remove Hemingway from classroom curriculum. At least where I teach (eastern US)
I'm a teacher in England.  We teach the metric system and I was never taught imperial measurements.  We use miles though, just to be confusing.
Are you a teacher? Because I'm a teacher. And that sounds like my life.
THIS! (Source: I'm a teacher)
Was looking for this. I'm a teacher with an anxiety disorder. Makes for some fun times. 
The thing is that I just can't see Kevin being real... I'm a teacher - and I've taught some dumb shits. But Kevin is just something else.  I think he is an amalgamation of several dumb asses that the OP had taught.
I'm a teacher, so I guess that's something. Also,  I adopted my dog so he's in a loving home. It may be small, but I at least changed his world. 
I'm a teacher. Hope it helps! :)
I'm a teacher now, so little's changed, I just get to come down hard on the popular, annoying kids who I didn't get on with when I was a pupil. There will be no mercy. 
Well the plans are "we want to leave this town, but one or both of us needs to find a job elsewhere before we do anything" I'm a teacher so job postings for the next school year are just coming up now...
I'm a teacher and this is my entire career.
Haha good! Yeah I love these. I'm a teacher so you better believe I'm saving this thread for that last awkward minute of class. 
Mumbling can be. Some kids ate shy and don't speak up because they're scared shitless.  Mocking then for speaking reinforces that fear because hell speaking for them mocked.Source: I'm a teacher with many shy students
In a question like that, the topic isn't owl digestion, it's interpreting the table. The owl digestion is a framing device to give the information on the table context.I'm a teacher.
I'm a teacher, and there are only 3 rules in my class:1) show up2) try your best3) follow my directionsWorks for real life too. 
That cannot be real. No self-respecting human would open herself up to liability like that. (I'm a teacher.)
I'm a teacher too. I've had all of these types of students I'm not naive, but not judgmental  either. Labeling does nothing except confirm our inborn beliefs as people and disallows any potential someone might have. 
I used to get kicked out of class for being annoying. Yep. For asking too many questions. I loved tenth grade. Anywho, Mr S, the history teacher, used to mimic me after kicking me out. I'm a teacher now and he's my prime motivation to be awesome.
[Kaiser Chiefs - Never Miss A Beat](https://youtu.be/_GYnd3Qp-UA)"It's cooooooool... to know nothin'...."I'm a teacher.
I'm a teacher and my students told me they thought reading was stupid because it "makes you antisocial."
meh, I'm a teacher and I don't read the notes. figure the kids appreciate not being thrown in front of the bus.
I'm a teacher and with the exception of some Professional Development, my summers are still like this.
I'm a teacher in training, believe me, I've thought about this too. There have definitely been attempts at harnessing this phenomenon, but to be honest they're mostly horrible wastes of time, which is a damn shame, but it's tough.
I'm a teacher, one of my students shared a bed with his dad because he didn't trust him not to spent all night playing on his cell phone.
No.  I'm a teacher, so every summer I'm a stay-at-home dad.  I'd lose my mind if I had to go for more than 2 months of that.
I'm a teacher. I recently had a confrontation with a female colleague who struck Hemmingway from her curriculum over his misogyny. She wasn't an isolated incident either, and it isn't just Hemmingway. 
I'm a teacher so only one day of exams and 364 of worry.
...she sounds like my kind of person. I'm a teacher. Both of my parents were teachers. Grandparents on both sides were teachers. She sounds like she cares about them but lacks significant filters.
I'm a teacher too.  And yes, the point of the question is to interpret a table.  And yes, they can perhaps get the answer to the question without knowing what an owl pellet is.  But it may also add confusion and uncertainty.  
I'm a teacher and just bought a camera, they'd be right. 
I'm a father of four and I'm a teacher. I'm perfectly comfortable in those situations. If a mother wants to be suspicious for no reason, that's for her to worry about.
I've always taken offense to that statement to be honest.I'm a teacher myself.  I teach because I want to help students succeed later in life, and I enjoy helping people.There was nothing else I wanted to 'do'.
I feel like I'm going to be in a child's creepy memory in the future. I'm that girl that says, "hey, need a ride?" But lower your voice and make it really creepy. I swear I'm a teacher and I don't touch tots!
I'm a teacher, and I browse reddit all of the time on my phone.  No one has caught me (yet).
I can look at people and, with a reasonable level or accuracy, guess what sort of thing they wear to bed. This isn't relevant for my cv though, because I'm a teacher. 
I'm a teacher and my last day of having a free block where I wasn't teaching from 9-4 straight was on Monday. I am sooooo tired. 
I'm a teacher and have two weeks left of school. I am 29 weeks and have done everything I can before I get my final things from my baby shower. I wish I would've waited because now I will just sit at home and wait for him for two months lol. 
COBRA is an option, most likely, but I'd have to cover the full premium. I'm the sole income, plus I'm paying back student loans. I'm fairly confident I'll find work before it gets too dire (I'm a teacher). Thank you so much!
Okay, thanks. I'm a teacher so I'm up and down all day. I probably have not had enough water today for sure so I will try that and moving around as much as possible.
I feel fine when I'm lying down.  Unfortunately, I'm a teacher, and there are only 4 weeks left in the school year, which makes things extremely busy, and I don't have time to be sick right now. :-(
Meh, I'm a teacher and I have moms who are much older than you, and me, who dress flat out slutty. As long as your are comfortable, ware whatever you want!
Unfortunately, I'm a teacher and gold is not something I've got going for me in my life.
What a great, succinct way to define respect to children. I'm a teacher too, and this is perfect for my students as well!!Awesome!!
Today is my birthday and I'm a teacher. Got any ideas for a good Star Wars tattoo?
I'm a teacher and I saved my personal days for this :)  
I'm a teacher in Melbourne, most of my colleagues own houses. Melbourne is cheap compared to Sydney. Partner up with another teacher and with a combined income of 200k pa you can find a nice house somewhere.
I'm a teacher. There are 600 kids called 'mate' as far as im concerned
I'm a teacher. Do I think the programs can help? Yes. Will the kids they need to reach attend? Questionable. Here's an idea: put money toward adult education. Create programs to help educate and support the parents of these kids.
I can see that, but if someone said oh I'm a teacher. People don't say I hate kids! Or I hate cooking to a chef. Do they?...
Teachers don't necessarily make good parents. Your ex may become a great mother, but I'm a teacher myself and have known since age 7 that I'd be not so good.
Hey p5 here, im interested, dotabuff.com/players/131177580.   Steam custom url bab6893. I can play every day almost, small things like visiting girlfriend and I'm a teacher so summers off is my schedule
I'm a teacher and this upsets me so much. Those kids are so vulnerable and need us...
I'd be really interested in working out too. I really want to join a gym just for machine use but I'm a teacher and looking for summer employment so I don't really want to add new bills to my plate. sounds awesome. 
I'm a teacher in Minneapolis, you should think about open-enrolling, PM me if you want any more info.
I'm a teacher; so any name I've ever had to shout 100+ times! Jack, Caleb, Kyle, Gary, Adam, Daina, Demi, Mandy, Chris and Emma spring to mind straight away!
Thanks for clearing this up! I don't really have a desk job, I'm a teacher so I'm on my feet for around 3 hrs or more a day, the rest is say is when I'm at my desk planning or marking. Is that still considered a sedentary job?
I'm a teacher.  Now I'm the coolest teacher ever and the kids' parents are jealous of me :)
I wish I could customize digital faces to have seconds. I'm a teacher and I like knowing when class ends exactly. Analog faces are OK but i prefer digital.
I will have to try that out if these other options don't work. I'm already exhausted nearly all the time, but school is out this week (I'm a teacher) so bring on the mid-day naps.
Grown for doing coke or breaking up nugs. Source: I'm a teacher and a lot of my students have these. 
Blacklist that sub from your school.  I'm a teacher, and I don't put up with that shit.
Nah.  I'm a teacher, and this was a passion project, not a business.  That's why I put up the blueprints.
Why were you messaging your teacher in the first place? I'm a teacher myself and I nearly had a heart attack when I saw 'sent via SMS'. He shouldn't care about your social life and doesn't need to be 'kept in the loop'. 
I'm a teacher and I'm genuinely curious about this: Is it acceptable practice to add students on social media after they've graduated from HS or after you've left that teaching position working with them?
I agree. If possible, let go of the job. I'm a teacher in a public school in South Africa where kids are often loud and some more effort during home time is unfortunately required. Sorry that you are having a tough time. :-(
Most poorer schools do get more from the government (that's what decile ratings are for) but higher-decile schools still have more money overall from fees, donations and the like. Source: I'm a teacher.
 &gt; Not all workplaces require you to be clean-shaven.I'm a teacher at a rather strict school. I'd say a third of the male teachers have a beard.
I know Latin and I'm a teacher. But yes, the k-12 schools which offer Latin are few and far between. There are actually quite a few in the LA area, but inevitably they are private schools located in super-rich neighborhoods.
I'm a teacher.  This is exactly how some of my 6th grade students act when I tell them to do something. 
I'm a teacher and wake up early. Cuddyer should hit a homerun so I can go to sleep.
I just did eight teacher gifts for daycare. I'm a teacher. No one from my class got me anything. Principal is buying us lunch though. So that's nice. 
Come summertime (I'm a teacher), I'll be in town a couple times a week.  I'd be up for a beer sometime.
I'm a teacher and while I don't accept at all, to play in my class, I am guilty to play HS (and now sometimes HotS) with many of my students.
I mostly support this, but just want to say I'm a teacher and the women I teach with are much more into gaming than the men. One is a LoL community organizer and another has actually read most of the Halo books.
I'm a teacher, not a doer. :)^^^fair ^^^point.
I'm a teacher, tons of time off, the investment in gear works because of the number of days I get to play with it.  
Weapons? The squid wins, 10/10.I'm a teacher. I'm actively involved in the next generation. And I am here to tell you that a squid with weapons will beat a nine-year-old kid flat.
Haha,no worries at all!  I'm a teacher I have zero time to do much else but browse!
Not professor - I'm a teacher :). And I haven't seen your assignment yet, so I'm not sure what to say about it - or do about it.
I'm a teacher, and these corrections drive me nuts. It's Reddit, man. Calm down. 
I'm a teacher, so know what I'm talking about...43 English accent...do you have kik so we could take it somewhere more private?
Congratulations.Now spend the money on yourself. I'm a teacher (IT/Development), and if you've put the work in that you should have, treat yourself

Pathology of a typical pedophile is to create a false narrative and rely on such weak points as evidence. "I'm a teacher, that's why I choose to be around the most annoying and illogically emotional our species have to offer"
I'm a teacher in the district. Subbing is fine depending on which school you are at. The district is in desperate need of subs. DM me if you have questions about specific schools or about hiring practices in the SDP. Good luck!
I'm a teacher's aide in a grade 1 class.  We had 2 children this year the refused to make presents for their mom's. The teacher and I knew exactly why and it hurts your heart to see it.  
Because they have a small amount of power. But most teachers aren't like this. Source: I'm a teacher
I'm a teacher and I abhor dictionaries for that reason. How are you going to find the word if you don't know what it looks like?
I'm 24 and I'm a teacher... have been teaching in some form since I was 18. At one point my students were older than I was. Didn't mean they were more qualified to teach than I was.EDIT: Added clarification since it was confusing people.
I'm a teacher. And bipolar. It's nobody's business what I have and they can't deny me employment because of it. It certainly doesn't make my job/life any easier but I'm still an effective educator. 
I'm a teacher and would like to show my students a cool documentary about space. We have about 100 min time, ages 13-14. Thanks!
I'm a teacher, we have state tests called "End of Instruction" or "The EOI"
Funny, I'm a teacher and I was going to say the same thing. Wait no, it'd definitely be "The Staph Meeting" 
What if I'm a teacher?  ANSWER ME OP!!!!
I will ask them. Problem now is he only has 2 weeks left at daycare since I'm a teacher. Then we start a whole new schedule.
I'm a teacher so it didn't work for me either!Work is first. It's been fine and she'll be 11 months tomorrow. I went back to work when she was 9 weeks...
That's exactly what I was thinking.  Highest career aspirations with a BS is, what, teaching?  And nothing wrong with teaching - I'm a teacher and am making $70k, but I don't think she'll be making that.
I'm a teacher to 12 year olds. They will write stuff in their journals about their families, their pasts (some abusive) and make notes like "don't tell my mother this... She thinks I have forgotten but I haven't." They won't forget. They'll remember. 
I'm surprised it hasn't been prosecuted to be honest. I'm a teacher and have seen parents referred to social work for chronic malnutrition, whether it led to the child being underweight or very overweight.
I'm a teacher, and it always seems strange to me that a teacher wouldn't read. It occurred to me that, "of all people", a teacher should have a love for reading. The comparison just popped in my head. 
I'm a teacher and I discussed this quote in class last week. My students (freshman) compared it to television shows. Great minds watch Discovery, average minds watch CNN, and simple minds watch The Kardashians or TMZ.
BTW - I adore your flair.  Everytime I see you post I smile!  (I'm a teacher)
Is that like taking a test and getting every single one wrong?  I'm a teacher and I have yet to see someone do this (on purpose). 
lol, good girl!  (I'm a teacher in real life)
I'm a teacher so it's fairly easy for me. Most sentences need to start positive.. "Nice try, try keeping the crosshair at head level, that'll save you a quarter second when you start your spray." End with the benefit. 
I'm a teacher. For fun I like going to the movies with my daughter's or hang out with my friends.
I'm a teacher and I get SO MANY candles! I prefer the other common gift I get--Starbucks gift cards! 
Some asshole taught my kids this thing. All 25 of them spent this week trying to do this instead of literally anything else I told them to do (I'm a teacher). Fuck you, random facebooker. 
I'm a teacher, and they've made it statutory for us to teach and promote "British values" as part of the curriculum, at all levels.Nothing like a little healthy use of education as an ideological state apparatus to manufacture consent.
^this qq. Thankfully I'm a teacher and I'll have all the time in he world in a few weeks. 
I love how you see me as a Viking. I get that every single day. This is a kick ass drawing. Or was this done on computer? Awesome awesome job. My kids (I'm a teacher) will go wild over this picture. Thanks a mil! 
I'm a teacher in a very conservative state. My students every year notice eventually then participation just trickles away. Now I have like 3 or 4 who actually do it once the pressure is removed. 
lol, I tend to stop giving a fuck for months at a time and then notice how bad it looks. I'm a teacher at a private college so I'm hesitant to get anything too avant-garde (which is pretty difficult to define) otherwise I'd take that in a heartbeat. 
I'm a teacher so I only have access to [non-toxic and safe](http://i.imgur.com/wx7lRf6.gif) stuff.
I reckon it might partly come from it being used sarcastically, like, say I'm a teacher and you're fucking around and I'm like "why *exactly* are you making your brain into turd?""what *exactly* is the point of arguing on the Internet?"Etc. 
We're having a senior send-off meal (I'm a teacher) and we ordered in high-end BBQ.  It. is. delicious.  I'm struggling between eating all the foods and dealing with the nausea that I'm already starting to feel.The struggle has never been more real.  
Wow, no kidding. I wish I could get [this](http://www.lookhuman.com/design/38267-im-not-always-a-bitch-just-kidding) one but I'm a teacher &amp; my city is too small for me to wear this anonymously.
I'm a teacher, never a had a bill this big before what's wrong with it?
Beautiful. This looks like my cup at work. I'm a teacher, and when I had a sub the kids told me she drank coffee from it. Then I washed it. The stains are remarkably easy to remove, but who would want to remove them?
I'm a teacher my Union sucks, my governor hates us, my pay sucks , but I love going to my job every day. 
If she a teacher I'm a teacher too
Hey, I'm from Detroit! I'm a teacher. Got the day off. Had family reunion in Texas last year. Holla at me!
I'm a teacher.  There is no down time.
Haha... Well, I'm a teacher! But biology is my favorite thing to teach :)
I'm a teacher too.  In 9 weeks the summer break starts. :/
Can confirm: Can name more US states than UK counties.  Only know where Hertforshire, Bedfordshire, Devon, Dorset, Cornwall, Hampshire, Kent, Essex and East Anglia are on map. I'm a teacher, we don't cover it in primary.
Yeah, I'm a teacher and while I can't wait for school to end I'll be getting bored come July!
I'm a teacher. School gets out June 3rd. I will not have a summer job. After a couple weeks of classes (PD), I will have no idea what to do with my time. An rpg or 8 would serve me well, especially if my girlfriend ends up going back home before I do. 
How old were you when you wrote that? I'm a teacher (11th through 13th grade), and I can't even begin to imagine how I would react.Very powerfully written.
I'm a teacher. Having my students make Mother's Day cards is difficult, especially when I see their loving moms appreciating the heck out of them. I've been NC for over 20 years. 
Never done this, I'm a teacher at Willow Oaks and have to tutor 2 kids after school today. Would love some pizza to feed them as snacks  between their homework :) Can provide verification. Thanks for doing this!
Control + Tab is also good. I'm a teacher and apparently other teachers (especially when I was student teaching) didn't know about tabbed browsing. Students realized pretty quickly they weren't going to get away with that in my classroom. 
I'm a teacher, finals are almost over, and I don't have a job next fall. I'll have all summer to look for a job and play this game. edit: plus, I'm 34, so I'll get the references to older games and probably appreciate it more than some.
