The title had me scared, but I'm glad that this is just a new entry in the series with a different sales model.
I'm glad you called but maybe they haven't heard about the changes. If not, well then it seems AT&amp;T is still doing their AT&amp;T things...
Can you ask your Dad if he's a fan of Kenneth Patchen?  Also, speaking as someone who thinks religion and gods are a toxin to humanity, I *still* think it's quite beautiful.  Well done, for sure.  I'm happy his belief brings him so much joy.
I'm glad we won like we did but I am disappointed the offense did not produce much for LSU. I think the other QB may have played better than JJ but apparently the locker room and team supported JJ.
I'm glad that we got him in the draft (as a Chiefs fan). He always seemed like a genuine kid and I think the fans will love him
This is a good tieracide approach to buffer tank modules.I'm glad you didn't propose dicking with larger mods (just frigate/dessy sized).Only issue I see is theorycrafting around T3Ds could get a bit OP.
Yay, I'm glad to see this return. I'm learning them, but I still don't recognize half of the ship names I see. At least now I'll be able to tell it was a battlecruiser that vaporized me without having to right click on it and get info. &gt;.&gt;
If Bader had been given the shot versus Johnson, what would he have done to beat Johnson? Bader would have probably relied on his wrestling but I think Johnson has around a 84% takedown defense. Cormier has better striking than Bader and maybe wrestling is a push. I'm a fan of all three fighters so I'm glad Bader didn't get the title shot yet because he has some room to expand his game. I rather not see him lose now on a short notice title fight and then get set back.
I'm ok with this. Some of the older gamers can probably relate to me saying that I'm glad patches are part of gaming. I remember buying games way back when downloading a patch wasn't a thing.
I'm glad you know how to form combinations. Other combinations for your consideration include: men hitting men, women hitting men, and women hitting women
I had a similar sized guy dropped on my head/neck at a Lamb of God set this year, I already had a migraine but I was powering through in the 2nd/3rd row and then that happened and I saw stars for a bit. I'm glad it was the last show of the night for me.
Her eyes are simply gorgeous!  And she looks very happy and chilled out :)  I'm glad she found a loving home &lt;3
I'm glad to hear your dog is doing good, thank you for the kind words!
Thank you. I barely remember what they were like because I was only around 8 years old when I first watched the series. I'm glad now that I can see what I watched when I first got into the series.
Ya it seemed like a ton of media members were saying "I think Curry will definitely win, but personally I'm voting for Harden" to the point where I kinda started to think they might actually become the majority and no one would vote for Curry because they thought everyone else was going to. Needless to say, I'm glad it turned out the way it did.
Thanks for the compliment man. One of my cousins has been a diehard Warriors fan since he was a kid and I'm happy to see them as the best team in Cali.Again, just wanted to clarify that it wasn't my video (and neither was the comment about emailing the nba... I'm sure the executives of both teams front offices can pay someone to pull clips and send them in). I watched it once and this one play really stuck out as absurd.I'm glad I started this thread even knowing that it would be controversial. It seems like the fan bases that dislike moving screens being called the most are the Spurs, Warriors and Hawks. It makes perfect sense since their offenses all have very high assist to FG made ratios and rely on ball movement and timing coming off of screens.
Well I'm glad that's settled!  His own head coach put an end to this! 
Man, even though I'm happy the Clippers won, this is the worst I've ever felt about one of my teams knocking another out of the playoffs.  And hell, I'm a Habs fan who just watch our team end the Ottawa Senator's amazing run.
Yeah, obviously it would benefit us to have him back, but he is no position to be making demands. I'm glad Zimmer is taking the next step to put him in his place.
I'm glad you healed. There's a reason medicine is an "art" rather and a science. 
You are a reasonable jets fan. I'm glad you don't just troll the whole deflategate situation. I wish all fans were more level headed. 
Good. I went there when I was a kid and they didn't let me play with shit. Big lied to me. Fuck FAO.Edit: bring on the hate. Fuck fao, I'm glad they're dying. 
It was. But I'm glad it happened. When my children ask me what it was like living during the pot prohibition, and what my experiences were of buying drugs illegally, I'll regale them with this anecdote. Then light up a fat, super high quality, 100% legal J.
I'm glad to hear my guild isn't the only one having trouble.  We're on a medium-pop realm with not exactly the most active raiding community, and we're pretty casual, but still, it seems like it's especially bad for this early in the expansion to me.  After having to watch several skilled and seasoned raiders quit playing, we're pretty much taking anyone with a basic understanding of the game who's willing to come in the hopes of bolstering our numbers a bit.
I see a lot of myself in this story. I'm also a trans woman. Until recently I was definitely an INTP. Even the way I processed thoughts was synonymous with INTP. As I've started to transition and open up more, though, I've slowly realized that I have become an extrovert. I recently took the test again, and it confirmed my rather large personality change. Now I'm an ENTP right on the line (like 1%) from being an ENFP, but it feels more natural to me. Maybe we didn't change, but rather we stopped hiding so much from ourselves. Either way, I'm glad you're happy with your new outlook/personality too! 
Great. I'm glad we got that covered. I was worried we weren't going to watch Game of Thrones later. 
I'm not either. Which is why I'm glad he's something other than Christian. Sorry not sorry.
Thank you very much for the reply, and I'm glad everything worked out with your family.
Do you really think Jessie's life would have been that much better without Walt? He would have probably been being raped in a jail somewhere as he was going to cook meth either way, and Walt basically kept them both out of trouble for a while there.Of course he's a dick, and a guy who went on a power trip. I knew he would not survive, and I'm glad he had a measure of revenge on the Nazi's before he died. I do wish his family could have received his money though.
Wait, dying love and absolute hatred? Doesn't that mean you just hate me?In any case, I'm glad that I could share my "fun" once again. 
That's great, I'm happy to have helped!
Waisted my time reading this.  And why would you write an  article after 4 episodes. I like the animated slow and love watching it with my son.  I also love the comic.  I'm happy with what the slow does with both April and Karai. 
I'm glad I didn't damage your race.The headtracking is really nice to use; being able to adjust the view a little bit is really handy. I'm using a TrackIR with the TrackClip Pro, which is pretty expensive, but works brilliantly (unless you have [an itchy ear](https://youtu.be/OFwZuL5aiPU?t=1529) and are using a clip-on on your headphones for the tracking).There are cheaper alternatives that use a webcam you could always try. They would, naturally, depend on the quality of the webcam and the lighting, which is why I opted for the TrackIR, which uses infra-red.
Exactly, you gotta troll them"I'm glad you're out here today demonstrating your love for this great nation of ours by exercising your first amendment rights! Thank you for showing how awesome this country is! God bless America"
I'm glad you said something. I didn't notice the last 3 pictures. Very cool car when it looked new.
I'm definitely a bleeding heart with the too, which is both why I'm glad to do this and why I'm probably going to struggle here. I've almost taken home way too many dogs haha. Luckily our new girl is adjusting well, and things are great so far. Thank you!
I'm glad your leg is better.  I could see this as useful.  
That was actually the most interesting part of the post. I'm happy somebody else felt the same way as me, but sad somebody else got all the karma for thinking the things as me. Such is reddit.
&gt; I'm glad you didn't hit one and get all exploded. How would an electrically primed round detonate from being hit?
My father is proud of what I've done, granted it isn't much, but he's also glad of the person I am. I try to be a good person and will try my best in my future. But he's also one of my best friends too. I know Highschool isn't some big thing, but I'm glad my dad and I can celebrate and I'm glad he is my dad, along with being my friend. 
I'm glad to see a Charlie Hebdo type massacre was PREVENTED for once. 
I'm glad they found that little fuck. I saw the video of him with his backpack, jump on his bicycle and ride off after stabbing the hose. He needs to go to prison for a year or two.
&gt; Yes. I'm glad you understand me.Well then I really hope that someday in the future you have responsibilities for a loved one at society's fringe. And that, despite handling the 24/7 extra challenges of this responsibility pretty well, *something* happens... and you find yourself needing the *tiniest* of favors or flexibility.And that a smug/selfish shit (like the you of today) laughs in your face and insists that no exception -- no matter how small -- should be made to accommodate your needs. *Because you should have prepared for the possibility of this happening.*That will be justice.
Well, I don't know how I'd feel about that if circumcision had great benefits even in a first world country, because then it becomes more like procedures like bracers; kids generally don't want them, but the good outweighs the pain for a few years.I hated them at the time but I'm glad I had bracers looking back.But since circumcision has basically no benefits in a first world country, that is a big consideration.
I'm glad I got to see someone actually eating the pizza!  So weird to know that someone from Cleveland can send someone in Texas a pizza and a couple hrs later see it being eaten.  Glad to help out! :)
That would have been a hell of a thing to go through. I'm glad you're still with us. 
I was on Accutane in middle school when I had super heavy acne on my face and body. It helped alot but it dryed me out to the point my lips were always severely chapped, I had regular nose bleeds, and thinning hair. I had to have regular blood work done to make sure nothing horrible was happening. After it was all said and done it did help alot and I'll say 85% of the acne was gone and I went back to normal not dryed out me. I'm glad to see it all work out for you and everything cleared up.
This was one of the best toys I ever had and my parents found it at the dump.  It didn't have all the stickers but it still fucking dinged.  I can't believe someone threw out such an awesome, perfectly good toy, but I'm glad they did.
I'm glad somebody else doesn't get it. Apparently coons is a nasty word for black people. I had no idea.
So you'd be totally ok with it if it was you out the money instead of PayPal?  Yeah, didn't think so.  He stole the money from PayPal with a dishonest trick. In fact what he did actually is a felony-  its fraud and he could be prosecuted.  He had no right to get PayPal involved in this situation without their knowledge, and I'm glad the universe slapped him for it.
Your stance on this is so laughable! I'm amazed at how hard you're defending a stranger's offensive behavior, and how blind you are to how wrong the situation is. I'm glad OP got caught. Maybe it'll open his/her eyes to the shit they're contributing to this world.
Good for you, I'm glad you gave a hand jibber to your dog. 
Tiny, though I random a lot and I'm happy to play any farm-heavy core.I enjoy the challenge of winning my lane with the weakest lvl 1 hero in the game.
I'm glad they went with the head, it looks so damn cool. And the tail looks lame. I think there's already a tail that looks like that and the other rare tails look much better than this.
I did it once and was fineSure I was uncomfortable and actually eating it all was a massive pain in the ass and I wouldn't do it ever again, but I'm glad I did itDid you try it with an extract/essential oil?
Why is it sad?  The man has had one hell of a music career and has reached millions with that music.  Everyone gets old and dies (if they don't die prematurely) but not everyone has such a fulfilling life as Mr. King.  I'm not sad.  I'm glad, he made music that I have listened to my whole life, and even after he is gone his music will live on.
OP, this video and song are great. I'm glad justice was dealt; gave them a friendly reminder of how shitty that move was. Keep up the fantastic work. 
I never listened to Taylor Swift and thought "man I'm glad she worked her way up from nothing!" I'm trying to figure out why I should care? 
I'm glad I stuck this out.
I'm glad this gained traction :D!
Oh I just got that one! I'm glad to hear you enjoyed it, I'm excited to read it myself
Sounds good to me, and I'm glad the characters are compelling! One of the reasons I'm considering reading it is because it seems to be one of the only examples of an anti-hero from around this period. 
I read Jane Eyre when I was 13 and I think I always modelled myself after her without realising it, and I'm glad I did. Still probably my favourite classic. 
I don't recall listing server population as one of the challenges faced.The first point is closest, so let me expand. With more people, there are likely more guilds attempting to do endgame content. So now you are trying to recruit and convince someone that they need to join your guild to raid rather than the other guys guild. I'm glad for being horde in those days, since we had some decent people (but hardly top) but on the Alliance side, we had the people from Conquest that jumped games (which since you're talking so much about EQ, that name may mean something). 
&gt;from the xmenI'm glad you specified, at first i thought you meant from Batman ;)
I'm glad the bird escaped that nuclear blast alright 
I'm glad you aren't an engineer, we would all be back in the stone ages.
The game is so dull you have to do something else while playing it yet so interesting that you can't quit?That's quite the conundrum and I'm glad I don't face it.  I can't play a game that requires grinding.
I'm glad I'm normal and not black.
I'm glad I watched that
Oh so you are ashamed of yourself and you take it out on people who have the self-confidence to not fall into that trap? I have no issue drinking one occasionally and biking 65 miles, but your dogma doesn't factor in people who know how to balance good vs bad. I'm glad you were able to help yourself, but seriously this kind of condescending tone will do nothing to help others join your passion. Trust me on that. It becomes the same as a devout religious person trying to convert you. Speak kindly and allow them to live their lives, most of the work of changing behavior is whether the person is ready for that change or not. 
Oriental small-clawed otter and American river otter.I'm glad I settled on Oriental small-clawed otters. Much cuter =3=
Haha, I'm happy looking at things people have built. I'm not much of a city manager :3
Yeah, but then maybe that's the issue. The show tries to focus more on the supernatural aspect (the setting) then the characters (character development).I'm glad we finally saw Nick emote a little. It would be awesome to see him bitch to Trubel because that's what people do when bad stuff happens. I hope that the writers let us get to know the characters better. 
Hi there! I didn't see your post last time as I don't visit this subreddit so much. You have a nice list of 50 things to do in Korea. What keywords were you ranking in google for? Just curious and as to how you promoted the post to rank highly. I own [Teaching Travel](http://www.teachingtravel.com/) where I also post a lot of things Korean related. Some are well received, some are not. Here were my [best places to travel in Seoul.](http://www.teachingtravel.com/seouls-greatest-tourist-attractions/)Inside Korea I'd recommend Muuido Island 무의도 near Incheon.  It's a pretty sweet island, the tides are super low when I went during summer. While the beach isn't the most beautiful beach you'll ever visit, its worth visiting to camp in one of the huts and have a small beach party. A lot of crabs and starfish everywhere too! Other than that it looks like you have most places I visited, I'm glad you included 하회마을 and 경주 역사유전 지구. I did visit this waterfall north of Seoul one time. It was literally in the middle of no where, and someone drove me. They told me the name of the place, but I forgot as I was new to Korea then and couldn't remember anything Korean. Its suppose to be really famous, but I guess that wouldn't narrow it down too much. I have a photo of me lower down the waterfall, but it doesn't show much. Any chance you know of any popular waterfalls north of Seoul?You have some really great information on your travel blog. Did you ever consider investing in a better camera and updating the look of your blog? 
If you are serious about piano then you should switch to better piano or find another one to practice at least for a few hours a week. Acoustics are the best, but they are harder to maintain. People who play only digitals usually find them harder to play, because the touch and sound is so different. I recently started to use pianoteq, it makes my digital sound more like a real instrument. But still a keyboard is an issue, so I'm glad that I've also an upright.
Got 4 DD, 1 Shedinja, 1 FA Winona, Shaymin/Latios-EX, 3 wally and 2 mega turbo from 14 packs. All locked but I did want a FA Winona so I'm happy about that.
Awww yiss. I'm happy for ukiah, even though I live in san jose now.
That's also my projection upon corporate morality and not OP's character. I'm sorry that came off that way, but I'm glad that we've had this conversation. 
I'm glad :)
I'm glad you didn't end up having to deck him, its not the best way.
I saw another post on this sub a moment ago that was questioning what men think of the "dadbod" trend and a lot of the replies were in the category of "Who gives a shit?" and I think this is important to know when talking about male self image. From day one men are taught to be tough so all these little campaigns about body acceptance for women are completely irrelevant to men because we were raised to focus on things that are more pertinent.Men will still have body image issues but you won't see many men push for body acceptance because there are bigger fish to fry. Men are taught they are better when they improve themselves while women are taught that they are better by default and this is why every women is beautiful now while men are still the same.I think this trend tells a lot about how men and women value hard work and self improvement. I need to be harder, better, faster, stronger to compete while women can manage just the way they are and frankly I'm glad I was raised like this because that's reality. Life is fucking difficult and if you aren't willing to put the time in to get better then you're going to fall behind. This trend is a candy coated luxury that encourages complacency and laziness among goddamn adults. I want to get shit done, not sit and cry because I wasn't told I was beautiful for the 1000th time this week.
Haha nah its fine :) I'm glad people still enjoy me lol
Congrats on the clear. I'm glad Blizz finally removed the exploiter from the leaderboard. Now everyone can count it as #1. Have you found the items/tried the DW setup? The extra CDR seems like it would be beneficial for survivability on HC.
Ugh, I spent like 6 hours the other day farming her and didn't get the drop, while I'm glad it's not just me I'm also annoyed :'(
I feel like the video just shows how absolutely annoying winged assassins can be. They jump on you and just do ridicolous amounts of damage, especially when they come in packs. I'm glad I don't play hardcore...
That's great!Theroonco has mentioned some people from time to time, I've been contacted by the mod once, but I haven't seen a comment on the comment count either.Yeah part of the staff xD was surprised when I learned he was a regular user. He always seemed like a nice guy, but I'm not used to really nice people on the interwebs :P.Well, I'm glad you feel comfortable. As I said to you before, it's great to find a community you like online, I'm sure you'll keep interacting with more guys here and hopefully have positive experiences.
That's great haha.Yeah I understand must be pretty annoying, that's why I never do anything on phones.Hahaha some spying, I have to pretend to buy stuff, or pretend to be a patient calling to other enterprises to learn prices and such. It's pretty weird at times, like one doctor who wanted to sell me medicines on the street like they were recreational drugs lol.I see haha, yeah hopefully things go smoothly. One of the chiefs of products here will soon present a new medicine, I hope I get around sticking to watching her presentation this time, so I'm glad to be helping that area haha.
Thanks for trying it out; I'm glad you were able to make something you liked!  I would recommend adding [adobo sauce](http://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/dce07b8c-a0f5/k2-_5542a6a0-b1bf-4106-92dd-f1d03a7ae341.v1.jpg) to the beans if you want an extra kick, the sweet/spicy provides a good mortar of flavor for the beans/potato combo.
A Hard Day is such a good movie, I'm glad both leads won 
Mackie looks jacked. I'm glad they gave him more red than the suit before. I cant wait to see the new wings also. He is such a likable actors, and I am so glad that this guy is a superhero now.
I was almost too lazy to look at the "before" pics, but I'm glad I did. You went from a bitchy 6-to-7 to an attractive 7-to-8.
This dude should be awesome. I'm happy with it.
Don't understand why everyone is still so salty about him leaving. It's a fucking business, and honestly he made the best decision he could have. I do not think he could have picked a better place to go to try to win a super bowl in immediacy, and I don't blame him. Andrew Luck under center? You kidding?? It's only a matter of time before they bring home the cheese and I hope that when they do, Andre is on their squad so there's at least a little positivity to it. In 10 years I wouldn't mind looking back and saying, "Damn I'm glad Dre got that super bowl he toiled his ass off for years to get." He sure as hell deserves it, and rivalries aside, my respect for that man has never diminished. While it does suck, ya just gotta get over it. Imo, it's more important to view for him as a human being rather than an icon that we scrapped in an instant once he is left. When we verse the Colts of course I hope we stomp and 2-0 them. As long as the Texans are in hunt, you bet your sweet ass no other team matters to me, but in the end, I'm definitely pulling for Dre to finish his career off strong. Go get that ring you've been after big boi, but only if the Texans are out of the running that is! I can easily handle a year of the Colts being champions for that man's sake.TL;DR Stop acting like deer and get ya tongues off the salt lick fellas, there's more important things to be butthurt about. #FuckTheColts #ButGoDre
Thanks for entertaining my questions. I'm glad that Jensen has been helpful to you and we wish you the best!
*She chuckles, smirking slightly and sipping her wine.* I'm glad to hear it.
Mostly funny films, but I'm happy watching anything.
Thanks I'm glad my Luigi obsession is appreciated lol
My order was on the 17th of March, I ordered first thing in the morning. Not sure if that was the first day or not. I'm glad my order was cancelled as I did a trade for the 2 I ordered.
I'm glad we never got bare-ass Arstan.
I'm glad someone went through and actually did the math. It was obvious from the Globe's initial article that someone was seriously deficient in doing the math, none of the numbers jibed.What I had to say then:&gt;There's something drastically wrong with those numbers, from a simple mathematics perspective.&gt;Now, I'm not saying the president of the Carmen's union isn't at least partially off base, but the numbers the Globe cites simply don't add up.&gt;An average of 12% absences would be 6.24 weeks, or 31.2 working days for full time employees. That's in pretty stark contrast to the *57 days* they're also claiming is in the report. Even if we take the 57 out of 365, which wouldn't make sense because although the T runs 365 days nobody is scheduled to work that many days - even if we use 365 as the denominator, that only brings absences down to 15.6%.&gt;Similarly, the 5% to 6% cited from other transit agencies seems low if it's all being calculated the same way (e.g. including planned/paid absences for vacation and sick time). I know many of the T's employees aren't salaried, but that 6% basically represents 2 weeks of vacation and a week of sick time. I'd expect the *average* to be slightly higher than that when it's also including unplanned absences, jury duty, FMLA, injuries, etc. (say, like 7%, nothing crazy).&gt;One way or another, the Globe and/or the panel are playing fast and loose with the numbers, and that doesn't help anyone get an honest picture of where the T's inefficiencies lay.
I disagree. The remarks were said during a stressful moment in his life and quite frankly, a humiliating one at that. He was at the pinnacle of his career just a few years earlier and then finds himself getting heckled in a comedy club. What he said was repulsive. No doubt. But in his entire career, which spanned nearly 30 years up to that point, there has never been any behavior on his part to assume he was racist. No co workers, employers, fellow stand up comedians, extras, crew members, etc. I'm glad his true friends have forgiven him and are still standing by his side. 
I'm a fan of Elsa too, it's the fact that she's had a hard time yet is still strong despite everything and doesn't become a villain for it. I'm assuming he's seen frozen fever, the dress in that is cool! I'm glad he's being who he wants to be and that there is something that gives him the confidence when he needs it :)
I'm glad you believe in a party so much. You don't get much of that down here in the south of england.
this may work for some people but really not for the majority of people.  check this stuff out:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PoC8MuoM_Q    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9hi1rTp0Uw    basically explains all you need to know about macros.    For the lifting part: Lifting once per week is not enough volume nor frequency to stimulate your muscles of course there will be gains but will they be noticeable or really awesome? no.  of course lifting once a week is better than not lifting at all. But lifting 3 times full body gives you a frequency of 3 (duh.) for every muscle group.  Focus on strength first (mass will come, don't worry!) and get good at the big 3 lifts. The least amount of frequency you should have, according to research, is 2x per week.    But you probably know that there are a lot of peeps just doing bro splits with 1x week frequency and they make gains too. You can make gains on whatever program/frequency/philosophy but the key question is: What is optimal? Bro splits can work but they're not optimal. 1x week frequency can work but it's not optimal (atleast for hypertrophy purposes, for powerlifting it's a different page.. but this is getting to far.)    By tracking your macros and eating accordingly to them you'll put the right stuff into your body to make dem gainz. It's like chemist putting a solution or whatever together. He just doesn't throw in any amount of sth in there. The right ratio is important.    Shoot me your questions. I'm glad to help.
I'm glad.  I really excited for this game, and I'm willing to wait until they are happy with it.  I feel like a lot of games have been rushed lately and I don't that for The Division. 
Yeah to be honest I'd never heard of him, but I don't follow "lower level" front office very closely. But he has a good track record, so I'm happy I guess.
Well shit I'm glad Norway isn't in the same group as Canada
Thanks. A grim event, but I'm glad that they've got someone.
I'm doing the same thing. I'm glad this method bares promising results. 
I'm glad to help. How tall are you?&gt; packing up the house to moveAnother major stressor.  And your health.  Losing weight and getting fit will be a positive preoccupation as you get through this.  
I'm glad I'm not the only one who goes through bands quickly! I don't even wear the thing in water :/
That is amazing news!Good for him!I'm glad he realized that even he couldn't make that role good.
I'm going to end here because I feel like I'm repeating myself. The fake deaths is tiresome to the audience. Myself, and a great number of my friends are just really tired of it. We're talking about fake deaths, not actual deaths. If 8 people fake died in Harry Potter, I'd be tired of that too, same for Breaking Bad, same for any series or shared universe. Imagine if Dumbledore came back, and Sirius, and Lily and James Potter, and maybe even Voldemort prompting a new series. It'll get dull. Just like Supernatural and the 15+ fake deaths to their main character. It gets really old and played out. Let's just disagree to agree. I'm glad you don't have a problem with it, I hope I get over it too. But right now, I just can't stand it. 
3D can be implemented well, it's just rare. It's being used a ton because ticket prices can be scaled up. Gimmicky generally, but there's a case for it. Also: digital can basically imitate film now, so I'm glad you're ok with digital haha. If you handed me Alexa footage and let me grade a scene to be screened alongside the exact same image off 35mm film I guarantee you won't be able to discern which is which. True Detective pulled a switch for one scene (Alexa subbed for 35mm) and no one could tell. 
I'm glad such a hothead was part of such a big scene.
The fact that mediocrity is classified as a medical disorder and parents are giving kids amphetamines so they don't have to be average has nothing to do with you questioning a possible ADD diagnosis in OP? Are we on the same page? I'm glad your psychiatrist is a swell guy but you're doing a great job of making him look like an idiot. 
"Hehe, yeah. I had to attend late, since I worked at the hospital for a few years. Needed some good income. But I'm glad I came when I did. I've met some great people."
Man, someone call the janitor, cause shit just hit the fan **hard**!* [Figured when Fury said some friends helped dust off the helicarrier, he meant Coulson.](/spoiler)  * Is Andrew still around? I think Skye's gonna need to see him after all the dust settles.  * WTF is Ward's endgame here?Side note: went to see Age of Ultron earlier today after dropping my brother's car off to get it checked for an internal leak, and I'm glad I did.
I loved it. Also a good sign if he's giving her a sweet nickname. I've loved to be mad at him all season. Now I'm glad I can just love him.
I'm glad you agree with me. (:Baron Strucker is a major character in the Marvel Universe, and considering the criticism of the show not having any major Marvel characters and how the #itsallconnected strategy would limit the show creatively, what better way is there to respond to those critism than to have the whole season be a straight up sequel to CA:TWS and feature Strucker as the main antagonist? (the end of TWS sets it up perfectly) It's not like they have to change much of their storyline; they already have the S.H.I.E.L.D. vs HYDRA storyline going on anyway.
Watching this episode of SHIELD will spoil a real "aha!" moment for you in AoU, I had a lot of satisfaction in realizing that connection. It's no where on the level of CA:TWS though, in the grand scheme that one aha moment is a minor spoil if you watch episode 20 first.Still... I'm glad I watched AoU first, definitely the way to go if you can swing it.
Lol I'm happy too but let's be real here, they should have been 3-0 down at half time. Not complaining though. 
I'm happy for him, a bit disappointed he didn't rejoin us since we gave him somewhere to train for over a year but he probably deserved better than the first division. 
Watching them in the African cup was interesting. Their strikeforce is strong but their attack isn't as great as you would expect. Outside of Mane, they have no creators. The rest of their forwards can only play centrally which was why they don't even have space to call-up Demba Ba. Mane himself can become kind of predictable and teams try to take him out of the match through tactical fouls (which is why he's fouled often). If Senegal can find another creator alongside Mane, they will be really good. I'm glad they got a coaching change because they were using the 3-5-2 which wasn't really working for them. 
I'm happy he'll get to kick some ass with a team that believes in him.
I seriously hated my stay, and not in the love to hate way. I went for the first time two years ago to meet some of my SOs aunt and uncle that had recently moved for work. I'm a first generation American from a German family. We still rock a lot of the classic stereotypes (frugal, structured, punctual) to an almost comical amount. Vegas is damn near the complete opposite of this. I've been to NY, Chicago, München, Cape Town, but nothing has made me feel so sleazy, dirty, crowded, unsafe, and uncomfortable as Las Vegas. It's a hell hole. I'm glad I was only there for 5 days. I don't think I could've done anything longer. 
I'm glad you answered with an experience you had, thanks !
Meh, some of Reddit's rules are dumb, I'm glad I got to see this, thanks to your friends giving it a few votes.
I have great sex thank you very much. I can't really compare it to how good it would be if I weren't cut either, so I'm happy as a clam with my soldier's helmet.
&gt;Pre-processors like Sass and Less are too abstracted from production CSSIt's just the right amount of abstraction.&gt; this blinds us to detrimental effects of our actions during developmentNo, it doesn't. There are code conventions for that. I'd write the same code without a preprocessor. I'd just have to press more keys and I'd make more errors.&gt; locks us into vendor-specific syntax and featuresDrafts aren't standards.&gt; and ultimately puts too much distance between the code we write and the code that is delivered to our usersAnd that's a problem because...?&gt; You don’t need functions, if statements, extends, and other extension-language-specific features in your CSS.I do need variables, nesting, partials, and mixins. I don't need loops that often, but I'm glad they are there.&gt; Shut up, no you don’t.Fuck you, too.This is a poorly written article with very little substance and tons of filler. The author also assumes that the reader is a complete idiot. It's patronizing condescending garbage.
I think that's what I've taken out of this- I'm happy for him and glad we're in this together.
This is very helpful. It sounds a lot like what I go through daily with anxiety and other issues. I'm glad to see it's something that therapy can assist, but also realistically that I would have to work at this every day, and it's not a magical "cure."
I'm glad they separated that cost at least. This way I'm not still subsidizing phones if I bring my own.
I'm glad he admits that Hollywood didn't invent the back quiver "myth". Unfortunately, his first video did claim that the use of the back quiver was a Hollywood myth. When you make a claim in one video, you can't just redact it and say on the next video "Of course the back quiver wasn't actually a myth. It's just a myth that ***everyone*** used one". That completely changes the context of the original claim. But the damage is already done and the 30+ million viewers who didn't see this follow up video are now going to believe what Lars originally claimed.      Without getting into the historical inaccuracy of some of his points, his first video would have probably gone without nearly as many critics had he not been trying to say that he was reinventing/rediscovering archery and that modern day archery is inefficient. To people who don't understand the required kinetic energy to actually kill a target, it's easy to lead them to believe that "Legolas"-style archery is viable in war and hunting.     But after re-watching the first video and then watching his answers to the skeptics, I am wondering what his intent of the original video was? When he says one thing in the first video and then changes the context in the next, I wonder why he didn't just use the correct context in the first video?
This is the first time I'm glad to hear nobody cares about me 
I'm glad i was accurate :)
Thanks for the response, I'm glad to hear that I might be able to make quick progress. Could you clarify what you mean by diet being on point in this case? I'm ~150 lbs and 20% bodyfat with a daily protein intake of ~120g. Not very sure on the bf% and I can PM you pictures if you're good at guessing that sort of thing. Anyway, I'm currently on a 500 calorie deficit. Will it be wise to switch to something like PHAT right away or does that make sense only once I've reduced bf% and start consuming excess calories again? I'm starting grad school in August and want to program the next 3 months so I'm in the best possible aesthetic given the limited time.
I'm glad someone agrees. It always feels stupid to say someone should've passed when they scored by not passing but if he'd missed or it had been saved it would've been obvious a pass was the best option. 
THANK YOU OP! That's VERY sweet of you!!! :-) used to write poetry actually. Haven't in a while though. I would say it accidentally wound up having a nice flow to it, and that's probably what you're getting at. Anyway, I'm glad you liked it!! 
Ah. Well, yes it was - I was under the impression that your reference to the mythical beast was because you didn't recognize my deliberate misspellings. I'm glad we had this talk. 
Oh.  Well I'm glad I do the right thing and throw them away then.
Aye, time is always the killer and I'm glad you spent some to share with us. If you can think of little 3-5 minute instructionals that you can do while you are working on your normal work (perhaps), you would probably find more than a few patreon backers around here. 
I confirmed this with a marshal that weekend. I would've pulled my pistol but I was overheating and tired (it was the day after an op) so towards the end of the day I had shed my chest rig. I actually reached for my pistol, but then remembered I forgot to grab my mags from my pouches before I left staging.It really wasn't that bad to keep on target and backpedal to ~18 feet, but I just wish for the other player's sake I could've yelled bang or touched his shoulder lightly. I'm glad he was wearing a vest or it would've hurt.
&gt; Let's hope these figures keeps growing, especially in Gyumri. Armenia needs a healthy IT sector and I'm glad to see a focus on Gyumri, Yup, the government definitely deserves praise for their policy in attracting IT companies to Armenia.  This is the brightest spot in the economy, along with tourism, which they've also done a fair bit of work on.  Gyumri has so little going for it, the IT jobs coming in are incredible sources of income which will support entire families.Edit: I should also mention that the US government (USAID) spent tens of millions on promoting IT and Tourism in Armenia, and also deserve some of the props for this type of news!&gt; which is arguably Armenia's second and only other city besides Yerevan.I'm sure Vanadzortsis will have something to say about that!
Of course his name is Jim Bob.&amp;nbsp;I'm glad I had to look up who these people are.
If you had left it on, Antetokounmpo probably would've come out of nowhere and blindside your ass to the floor. What an infuriating game. I'm glad we won, but goddamn the Bucks disgust me.
I'm glad it wasn't serious and the three guys are okay
I know! I'm glad  I am not alone though :)
Thanks for reading. It feels good to write about these things that have had some sentiment or importance to me. I'm glad others can appreciate it in whatever capacity
Thanks for the down votes. Boy I'm glad snorting those tranax didn't work..... Wonder if I have amnesia because I don't remember shit from last night...but no way could it have been the tranax right
Hi I've been buying OP points before this all happened, and I got the multiple billing accounts issue and I was told by Tucker that it wont happen again.but I bought more OP before site went down and it happened again? so I still have 10k OP sitting in limbo - can I please have this addressed?I'm glad you guys got it resolved and have recommended you guys lots already!
What I'm saying is that I'm happy with this sub. Also, as a moderator of my own sub, I'd be annoyed if someone else tried to grab people from mine into their nearly identical sub in comments rather than asking to be added to the sidebar.
Yes. I have a game stop suicune, entei and a Australian darkari. But I'll trade for any decent shiney. Otherwise If you need to fill the Dex I'm happy  to help
My mom even used to call it "chemo brain" during her first and second times going trough therapy. Even long after her first, she would complain about fogginess and inability to concentrate or remember things. It is frustrating and I'm glad there's finally some research coming out about it. 
I'm glad you took your time. There are so many people who go at least once a week for a walk in rushing to fill up their free skin. It's kinda lame imo. Awsome sleeve, I've got 3 or 4 pieces from Tim myself, good dude. 
Thank you, glad I could help.And I'm kind of glad you felt you were missing the larger context, that's one of the things I love about finding little notes and journals in TES, having to work out the missing pieces yourself. This one is tied into a couple of things you can find in Skyrim, as well as some of my other stuff, but I did try to leave a few loose ends in there. I'm glad you liked it, thank you :)
Yeah, I'm glad I work off standard hours. I'm not looking forward to the traffic disaster we're all facing. 
I always wonder when I see young, fresh grads coming out of 16 years of schooling and slipping right into their phd in writing. The most important things writers need to do is to live so that they know what to write about.There is going to be a few people in any group of twenty year olds who have lived more in their lifetime than any dozen people who looks like them on the outside but has no idea how much the human soul can crack and still hold something of value. To those kids, I'm glad they've found writing an important safety valve. I was the type of kid who would have either discovered writing or been institutionalized at some point over all my anger. At our local con over the past couple decades, we've met dozens of young men and women who have just sold their first book to an important publisher and then we never hear from then again. It's tragic almost. Learning to write might be able to have the foundations taught in the class, and you can certainly be taught to write the kind of stuff that university writing profs like to read, but the degree itself is meaningless unless in all the structure that they've been taught how to write with has something they brought with them that they'd like to say.I have another friend who is ABD in her creative writing phd. She's a genre writer, so her future students have a chance to learn more than just how to impress writing instructors. She loves writing so much she wants to help the next generation find their voice. I respect that. But there are four parts to learning how to write, the skill set you have, the voice you have, your love for writing and your knack for finding words that had never been put together in that way before but means exactly what you need it too. Only the first part can be taught. The voice, the love and the knack should all be prereqs. 
New capability it great, I'm glad it's coming. I live in a one bedroom condo, this has zero utility for me.
That was nauseating at best. I'm glad work has picked up again and I can stop seeing as much of this shit online (luckily it's pretty rare in real life outside of college campuses and certain crowds), as it has genuinely started making me disgusted.
Alright, I'm glad we worked through this together. 
Sure I have. I'm married to a wonderful guy, and would never do anything to hurt him or jeopardize our relationship. But I'm still human, and feelings of attraction still happen. In a way, it's a good thing. I'm glad to have men in my circles who are kind, intelligent, funny, interesting, engaging, *and* my husband, who is the best thing in my life. Of course, when I'm feeling guilty for developing a crush, it doesn't feel lucky. But it's not the worst situation to be in. 
I'm glad I'm not the only one! Whew! :D
Finally. Jesus Christ finally. The two pages of them "saving" all the multiverses (even though it's literally just shots of heroes standing around) was more interesting than Convergence as a whole. I'm glad to see this done so I can read real books again. 
I'm glad that works for you? Not having a car and terrible public transportation doesn't quite make that practical for me at the moment.
Nice kit!  I ended up going with the Alesis DM10X.  I have to get mesh heads for it, but so far I'm happy with it.  The hi-hat samples kinda suck, but I can live with it.  
'Never usually'.. I'm glad you like! 
From all the paid mods, this game is the best mod ever created. I've played the free version before several times, I finally can repay them, yes they won't finish it and yes fuck that Shit and no no offence.I'm glad they did this. I understand if they want to recreate XEN,  black mesa won't be the same because of the huge technology difference. But I'll gladly pay for this version so I can finally repay them for all the beautiful work they've done! 
The fact that we didn't make a qualifying offer after his respectable 2013, and then immediately picked him up for super-cheap a few weeks after the Twins signed him mid-season probably didn't help his desire to be here.  And missing the first half of the season because his agent is a monumental asshat whose stubbornness cost him ~$7million probably pissed him right the fuck off, too.  I'm glad his mediocre half-year in Seattle didn't derail his career, because when he's healthy and happy, he's a beast.  I'd rather have Nelly than K-Mo anyway, so it worked out alright.
but....isn't he from Pennsylvania? Very cool nonetheless. I'm glad he is on our side.
I don't know why you're being downvoted. Anyway I'm glad to have a discussion with someone who possesses knowledge on a deeper level than most of the people on this sub.    In terms of jax I think he doing a shit job thus far and the respect he has gained in the basketball world has completely silenced any critic, at least in his first year and a half presidency.  For the amount of "Zen" in the zen master it is rather surprising how stubborn he is.  His offense won with his players.  His offense will not win with any players.    His offense has failed with Rambis and the Twolves and essentially every time it has been tried aside from those championship Bulls and Lakers teams.  Those teams also had arguably the 2 best shooting guards to ever play the game there to bail out the team.  The Lakers had an enormous amount of talent.  At some point if you put some of the best basketball players in the world on the court together they will win games regardless of offense.  Now I am not implying that this offense doesn't work, as it has produced championships but guess what?  Every type of offense has produced championships from the showtime Lakers to the bad boys to the spurs to the pistons in '04 to maybe the Warriors this year?  The 4 teams left in the playoffs are all the best 3pt shooting teams in the league.  The league has cycles where different styles of play are more effective.  Right now the midrange ball screen game is not effective in the least.  Phil need to evolve along with the game.  His offense isn't a magical formula.    In terms of his GM abilities he is horse shit.  He GAVE JR and Shumpert to the Cavs, literally gave.  These two guys are HUGE pieces to the Cavs.  Shumpert has a PO for next season and JR's contract isn't that bad meaning were not as desperate to rid ourselves of that salary money as the Cavs were in acquiring talent.  The Cavs were desperate, backs against the wall 21-22 maybe?  I believe the NBA sub voted that trade as the best of the season for the Cavs of any trade.    Even little things like having Steve Mills at the dias for the lottery, or not signing guys like Tom Robinson when he is FA this past season.  Or how about Phil openly discussing his desire to trade the pick if its out of the top 3 or 4?  Now teams realize they may get a better deal.  We should act as though we want this pick and then try and trade it so teams think its worth more to us.  He is showing everyone at the table his cards.    When we were still in contention for a top 2 pick he essentially told the media he prefers Towns over Okafor, these mistakes keep happening.  He reminds me of an old senile guy who just rambles and doesn't really know what the fuck he's talking about anymore.    Right now the NBA is in the age of the advanced metric and Phil along with the rest of the Knicks are stuck in the stone age.  It is really depressing and I can't wait for us to trade our 4th pick or somehow fuck it up...
I'm glad you like the game :)Regarding Steam, I'm hoping to have the game out in early access some time before September. I'm planning a trip for some months, which will mean suspending development, so I'd like to have the game on Steam before that.
It's affordable for me. I pay 900B for dress pants and 600B for button down shirts. The Thai style shirts are cheaper as well. As for stylish, I get to pick the fabric and patterns so I'm happy with the result. 
Finally!!! My Fan-Fic can become a reality! Hey Lewis? What are your thoughts on Simon, Sips, Sips's dad, Pyrion's wife, Evil Cultist Sheep, Boddypen and a hypathetical long lost brother of Israphel? Seriously though, I'm glad that everyone's taking it well and that Lewis and Hannah are on good terms.
Good man, I'm glad you liked it!
Sure. Most of the academic programs at BYU are on par or better than the average state school and much less expensive. I had plenty of progressive/NOM professors outside of the religion department. Another benefit is that it's  very easy to get into research there. Not many places take freshman/sophomores into the field with them.Were there people I didn't like? Sure, plenty. I hated the culture. That said, it only took me a couple months to find my friend group and after that I was happy as a clam. We drank, we did drugs, we went to concerts. If you miss out on the "college experience" at BYU it's because you didn't look  for it. Plenty of students find their way to UVU parties.I'm glad to see some people saying decent things about BYU. It's not nearly so bad as some people on the sub make it out to be.
&gt; By then I would have been more certain, mainly because he was dating guys.This made me laugh.&gt;  I still can't stand him, but not because he's gay.Well yeah. He lied to you, sucked you into a cult, and then continued to live a lie for 25 years. Plus whatever other issues you all had. Even if we can step back and say he acted under duress and brainwashing from the church, that doesn't invalidate your feelings and lived experience. I'm glad you were able to get out, and that you don't have any kids still stuck in it.
Yep. Best to blank out the names.  I'm happy to out myself though :)
Thank you. I'm glad to see I'm not the only one having problems with her eye makeup.  To me, the under eye liner with the fake lashes look like fake stitches that you would draw on your body for Halloween.
No. I refuse. I'm happy with my belief that it's not a thing. =)
Thanks. I was a bit exhausted by this match to be honest, not a lot happened. But I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Glad you're more self-confident now! It's hard being different in any way, and I've gotten a lot of less than fun comments because of my larger lips here, but there are so many people who love them that it's worth it! I've commented (with this account) a lot about having larger labia, and have now found myself as somewhat of a champion for women with larger lips, so rock on! Awesome pictures, and I'm glad to see them at /r/labiagw! You're always welcome there! :)
I'm glad you like
I'm glad you did.  Gorgeous
Hi Vanilla! Thank you for taking time to watch the video. I'm glad you found the A/V agreeable, but yes, I really should have raised that VOLUMMEEE. When it comes to the editing I still need more practice, me thinks. I love my intro too! I hope to make something a bit more flashy in the future!Thanks for coming out and commenting! I truly appreciate it.
Hmm ok, I'm glad you drew up your conclusion simply based off of my own observations and experiences.This place is overwhelmingly racist and old school conservative. The only aspect about it that isn't is its stance on gay rights. Which is a great step, but much further to go.
I'm glad you like it! Are you interested in modding?
Dude just rendered himself a civilian in terms of the Presidential Race. I'm glad that he not only thinks that, but let's us know he's batshit crazy. In this day and age, to think that approach is what's going to get you elected is insanity. Get with the times, or get rekt.
I'm sorry, but are you really arguing that the prime minister of a country waited 8 months for hip surgery because he was defunding a system he and his majority party supported wholeheartedly? Because that wasn't happening.I'm glad you personally are doing well, but that doesn't mean there aren't systemic issues with the programs your country has implemented, or that there aren't any major economic issues going on.
I'm glad you posted this. I hopped on about an hour before the testfire, and it allowed me to find out quickly when the servers went back up after they went down like 5 minutes in.
It's since gone up and I'm happy with the numbers(160 kg now for reps, haven't done a new max yet)
I'm glad a thread like this popped up, so now I don't have to make one. Add one more to the list of people who are sorely disappointed in how this sub has turned on Max. I understand that people may have had others from Worlds Apart they were looking forward to more, and that some people are just not interested enough in seeing him again to vote for him over other people they might have more genuine interest in--and that's totally fine! But I think the insane dogpile on how ~horrible~ of a player (and therefore how horrible of a person?) Max is just goes waaaay too far, especially because he's not just a contestant, but a member of this community. There is a reason that Max had so many gold flairs at the start of this season, and it's because there seemed to be a lot genuine enthusiasm on behalf of a lot of people to support one of their own. It's a little depressing to see that sentiment has run dry. Max clearly loves Survivor a lot--I mean, a lot of people do, so don't think I'm implying that simply being a fan means being entitled to the fan vote. I just want people to be a little more aware of how amazing it must feel to have finally gotten the opportunity to play a game that you not only love, but a game that is a large part of who you are, only to not do that well at all, and to then have a shot at a second chance dangled in front of you and have the same fandom you're a part of treat you with derision for getting that second chance. 
Opening statements are usually fluff and have no effect on voting, so it's a waste of time in my opinion. It felt weird that they didn't do them because of precedent but I'm glad since that's a good 3 minutes to devote to something else.
I'm glad Shane didn't get in because I'm worried what that would do to his mental health.
TL;DR: Asshole stole my dog, his redditor neighbour  saved the day.A guy stole my dog from my locked, fenced-in yard. She's a small Jack Russell that appears to be a puppy. She requires daily medication.After an extensive six-day search, I made my first ever post to reddit. I offered $1000 for her safe return.The 'missing' poster I linked caught a redditor's eye.  He or she messaged me and told me she/he thought her/his neighbour had my dog. They lived in the same apartment building about a mile from my home.The problem was that the redditor was unsure how to involve themselves because the Dog Thief appeared to be a rough-looking criminal (gang tattoos covering his neck, for example). The redditor told me the intersection where they lived. So I went and plastered the area with missing posters with '$1000 for the return of my best friend'. There are three apartment buildings there and I flooded each one with the posters.The next day the Dog Thief called me. He said he knew a guy who knew a guy.... that had my dog. In my search, I had advertised on Craig's List, Kijiji etc.  I had received dozens of calls from assholes who said they had my dog. But they could never describe the markings that I didn't make public.This caller did.  It was as if he was looking at her as he was describing them. He said 'some other dude' had her, and he'd get her back to me, but I knew he had her. I said to meet me at a public place and I would give him the money in exchange for my dog. He agreed.Then his wife called me back very angry: 'you're setting us up!!' I told her that my dog needed medical attention at this point, let's meet at a vet's office. She said no. I told her that my search for my dog was very public - it would be very easy for someone following the search to know where I lived and who I was. I told her my full name. I invited her to my home. She said they'd come over.It was a Sunday, and my brother and his EMS buddies as usual were hanging around my neighbour's home. I told them that the Dog Thief was on his way.The Dog Thief arrived with his wife and pulled right into my driveway and an EMS truck came in and parked blocking them. One EMT filmed it, one was taking notes. The Dog Thief turned to my brother and said 'I don't want trouble', as in 'please don't beat me, I'll go quietly'.Then I spotted a very sad child in the back seat of the car.The kid was holding my dog. The Dog Thief took the dog from the kid and started saying 'I'm so glad we found her for you! I'm glad she's home!'And everyone around just deflated. The asshole stole a dog and gave it to his child and now was using the child as a shield.My brother took out his wallet and handed over a few hundred dollars. I gave him more and said he could stop by tomorrow for the remaining $200. I told him he could buy a new puppy for his child. The kid just looked at the front seat head-rest the whole time.  Didn't say a word.The Dog Thief actually came back the next day for the $200. I wanted to honour the reward somehow.  The police found out who he was in the meantime. He had a long record.  But they said they wouldn't investigate it or likely charge him. His story was that he just found a dog and didn't know what to do, so he kept it.So he stole a dog, gave it to his child, put me through six days of hell, was 'caught' and returned my dog, making a $1000. The cop told me that the Dog Thief probably hadn't paid his rent in months, probably hadn't bought groceries in weeks.  And told me to up my security measures because he might be back.I have my dog back. I'm grateful every day for that.The hero redditor? They wouldn't accept reward money that I offered them. They were just happy I had my dog back.
*Edit: Just realized OP asked this of older* **gay** *redditors. Hopefully the viewpoint from a mildly bi-curious redditor is still welcome.*(I'm be 50 this year, for reference.)Forty years ago, here in the "kind-of" South (Southwest Virginia) the worst thing you could possibly be called was a faggot. It was the kind of insult that, even if said by a friend, could lead to a big fight. Some enlightened people would talk about the gay friends they had, but always with the qualifier "I told him I would kick his ass if he comes on to me!"But even then there were signs that acceptance was coming, though still a long way off. Billy Crystal's Joey (was that the name?) in the hilarious show "Soap" was one of the first gay characters that was played sympathetically for the most part. Other shows, like All in the Family, would have the occasional guest star role who was gay, and generally they weren't the caricature, stereo-typical gays that they would have been in the 40s, 50s, and 60s. Still, nobody I knew would have admitted to being gay, and again it was one of the worst insults you could throw at someone.I was part of the casual bigotry of the time (again, where I grew up), even through my teen years when I knew I was "curious", and had a couple friends that I knew to be gay or at least bi. By the time I was in the Army, though, I'd really changed my mind on the whole thing. I didn't really care any more what people wanted to do with their lives as long as it didn't interfere with mine. Now I actively support marriage (and other) rights for all people, and I'm glad that society is moving in that same direction. The dinosaurs who (mostly for religious reasons) want to deny equality to the LGBT community are becoming more and more marginalized, and it's a great thing! There will always be those who will look on the whole thing with distaste, just as there are still people today who think Blacks should not marry Whites (interestingly, they're generally the same people.) But change is coming; equality is coming; it can't be stopped and the RWNJs be damned!
And frankly, that's awesome. As a smoker.  Its definitely a terrible thing to do, and I'm glad it's becoming less common. As for the respect thing, that goes both ways. You don't like smokers, and I don't like elitist pricks. Everyone is better off if no one is either.
Okay, I'm glad I'm not the only one this happens to; I thought something was wrong with me! Hahaha 
I drove around all day trying to get my phone to work, but it's finally working, so I'm happy.
You did good. When I was bullied, I had to deal with it in a similar way. This piece of shit always used to push me in the locker-room because I was somewhat nerdy. I hit him in the face, hard. Broke his nose, if the blood was any indication. I lost that fight though. He slammed my head into the wall of that lockerroom until I lost count. I took it like a man, and went to my classes, black eye and fucked up, but I told everyone I was okay.I heard that asshole died in a car crash later. He had been drinking and driving. Good riddance to bad rubbish. I hope he didn't hurt anyone else, but I'm sorry to say I'm glad he's dead. 
Thankyou, I'm glad I'm not the only one! It took me several tries to even finish watching it. 
You know, I'm glad you asked. Dogs are fucking terrifying. I've never understood why people like you willingly interact with vicious animals.I mean, I know I only feel this way because I had bad experiences as a kid, but still.
That's idiotic.I'm glad I go to a British university and 100% of my courses are 100% relevant to my degree.
Or conversely, if they say they don't use a condom, say, "Oh! I'm glad you want to have my baby!" and see if that scares them into wanting to use a condom.
While I'm sorry for what happemed, I'm happy you found peace
I'm glad I got into one before they closed, I needed a hard to find fuse and didn't have the exact specs.  I was able to match the burned out one from their parts section.  To be safe, I bought all the ones they had left.
I'm happy with what I got. Well, I *learned* to be happy with it. When I was younger, I wished I was bigger. Now, it's just fine and I wouldn't change for the world.
I *was*. I thought that maybe it would get better if we got a house and had a baby. If you think a major life change will strengthen an already shaky marriage, it won't.  It'll only make the divorce that much worse.A lot of people stay because of the fear of how bad it is starting over. Starting over, for men especially, is awful when you're already in your 30s or 40s.  I'm glad I did it at 37, but it was 5 solid years of misery.
Nope no shame. I work third shift about half the year and you get to know the night shift at the 24 hour restaurants.   I'm glad their job exists. As for their pay, working somewhere is an individual choice just like all the others.   Your choices start early in high school and continue until you die. Do I hear their complaints about their job, yes. Do I empathize with them about their situation, yes. But do I think they are in their permanently, no. Do I think they can better themselves over time and move up a management chain or get employed at a better establishment, yes . So if you are stuck in a low paying job, work your ass off because it is just the first step on a long path. 
No problem! It's a pain to navigate researching visas, so I'm glad that the info I've gathered in my kafkaesque ordeals can be useful! :) I don't know of any visa that serves multi-countries. (Maybe transit visas of some sort?) Are you American? I've always been jealous of EU citizens who can basically just roam free and legally work in any Euro-zone country with no visa and no time limit; as Americans, it's not as simple as that for us. (Also, since the US doesn't tend to make it easy for certain nationalities to enter/get visas, those countries tend to...ahem...return the favor by making the process a big hassle for us too.) But I'd start out by researching which countries require a visa just to enter, as these are the most complicated cases. Also, you'll need to look into *where* you're required to obtain your visas. This usually has to be done in your home country at the consulate of the host country assigned to your home state of residence. So, if you leave without all of your visas, I'm actually not sure how that would work. I don't know if US citizens can get visas at a third-party consulate. It may be possible, but would require research.Many countries will not require you to have any visa at all *if* you're staying for under 3 months (this can be verified by your passport stamps from customs upon your entry and exit of each country, so don't try to fool them. I actually knew someone who got banned for 10 years from reentry into Spain once by ignoring the time limits! Their passport was flagged in whatever system, and this actually created problems for him entering in other Euro countries that weren't Spain because they didn't "trust" him...). In (Western) Europe, this is the case, for example -- 3 months with no visa required. (Eastern Europe can be more complicated for Americans, but I don't know specifics for each country -- best to check well in advance, as they do not hesitate to employ the full force of their labyrinthian bureaucracy and it can be a long and annoying process.) But be careful -- I'm actually not sure if this means that you have 3 months in Europe *total* or 3 months per country (I've never done it without a visa), but I highly suspect it's the former, unfortunately. Sometimes you can gain time, though, with little legal loopholes -- i.e.: in Western Europe you can stay 3 months without a visa, and IF you need/want to stay longer, then you have to leave and come back in again. BUT this can be done, in many cases, not by leaving Europe entirely, but simply by leaving the Schengen zone. (http://www.schengenvisainfo.com/schengen-visa-countries-list/) Then you can come back to the Schengen zone countries and your 3-month clock is basically reset. Disclaimer: I am not an expert on any of this though and am basically just going by my own experience. Always verify first, and leave plenty of time to do this. (And don't count on just getting your questions answered by calling the consulate; they're always major jerks and often will just tell you point blank that they don't answer those questions by phone and to check their website, which as it results, often doesn't have easy-to-find info.)I hope this helps! Maybe someone on here who has done a trip like that can give you better info than I can... And I'm sure there are people who do it on the sly without documentation and such, but this is a major risk for a lot of reasons, so just get as informed as you can about your options. Obviously, legal is better and you have access to resources in your host countries this way and you don't have to sneak across borders and do other sketchy/dangerous stuff. Don't get arrested in a foreign country! :) (Seriously though, Europe sees itself as having an immigration crisis right now and they're very strict about visa regulation, border control, etc. They don't care if you're American/white/Western either. And they don't care if you're a tourist.)
Nice try with that. I'm happy a picture pops up so I don't have to view the link. 
I think this is great, sorry for the troubles you've seen and I'm happy you pulled yourself out of it all.Plenty of people only smoke pot without going any further.
A bunch of season 1 is super uncomfortable.  I'm glad they've toned it down since then.
I'm 24 now and will be 25 next month. The past several years flew by too quick and I still don't know what to do with my life. I'm glad to see that not only am I not alone, but I'm not that old compared to most of you here. I of course wish you all the best of luck as I need some help with my life as well. I'm a college dropout, have a new office job but still earn little. First time working in an office, it's been almost a month, and sitting in front of a computer screen all day with Excel and those work programs makes me feel like I'm wasting my life with something I don't like to do. Worked in retail before, I'm glad I don't have to deal with general public anymore, but at least there was more action involved, I'm more of a hands-on guy. Old job paid much less though.What do I want to do for a living that I love? I still have no fucking clue, but doing what I do now isn't doing it.
The way your comment started I thought we were about to fight, but I'm glad it ended up the way it did
" Thanks! My friend said the same thing to me when i showed him. I just grabbed a picture off google. I'm glad you like it though. This is my first post so just a friendly comment means a lot. " lammmeeeee
Huh. You're right. I'm glad we had this talk.
!!! :D That sounds great! I'm glad that we were able to sort this out!
Wow that stinks. I'm glad you're okay!
I was a very light sleeper as a kid. I was lucky to get more than five hours a night. My dad traveled a lot when I was young, often being gone for weeks at a time. So one night when I was about seven I woke up sometime late. Unable to sleep I sat in bed and started reading. I'm not sure how long I was reading when I hear my dad shouting for me to come let him in the front door because it was locked and raining outside. My dad was out of state at that time, and it hadn't rained for weeks. To this day I'm not sure what was outside but I'm glad I didn't get out of bed to look. 
I'm glad you did. Pets are the best when you feel like everything's too much. There's nothing like being cuddled on to lift your spirits.
Well that's just absurd.  It bothers me because scientific research tells me that it's a threat to my health.  If you don't care about threats to your health, well, you're dumb.  If I spat on my hand before shaking yours, would that bother you?  One might argue that saliva is full of germ killing things and thus it shouldn't bother you unless I am sick.  So perhaps if we ever meet I should spit on my hand before shaking yours and say I'm glad I don't share that weakness.
So glad I read this. I almost subscribed my husband to this, and now I'm glad I didn't.
That's good. I'm glad to hear it. 
I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought that. It reminded me of the Dr. Bronner's soaps with the Moral ABC's rant written on them.
I'll pm you then. I was in the same boat as you so I'm glad to help!
Exactly. I'm currently in uni and my classes only have a handful of women. It's upsetting not a lot of women pursue fields such as this or engineering, but I'm happy some do. Just wish more did. Too many of my friends are pursuing nursing. 
For me, most of the time they're just there. I'm glad I'm not flat because they fill out clothing, but I've never enjoyed having them or felt like accentuating them. I think my ambivalence comes from getting them really young and hating the sudden attention that came with them. I'm a D so mine aren't tiny, but I've never had problems with exercising/running and I sleep on my stomach every night. When mine aren't just "there", they're achy as fuck in the days before my period, which basically feels like bad bruising.
Meh, I had my ears pierced at hospital as its pretty standard practice where I'm from. Frankly I'm happy my parents allowed that, instead of waiting until I was older and taking me to an 18 year old with an earring gun at Claires accessories. 
Different strokes for different folks. I'm glad you discovered what path you want to be on. 
I'm glad London actually has that etiquette.
Well said manI'm glad you have the right mindset
It's not easy. I lost both of mine by the time I was 25, and I still have those moments where I just want to call one of them and talk and get their help in figuring out what I should do. Time helps, but it never really goes away completely. If you want to talk about it, feel free to PM me anytime. I'm glad to talk.
I'm glad.  I've been in the same situation with my dog.  We both were pretty skinny there for awhile.
Yes. I still have bad days with mental health issues, but most of the time I'm happy. I have a good job, a great bf, some wonderful friends and life is good. 
While I'm glad it's just a symptom of pregnancy, lack of reliable treatment options worries me a little. Thank you for your reply. 
All good things to try! Keep in mind too that things that worked pre-pregnancy might not work now, and vice-versa. Things are just different for no apparent reason in pregnancy. I'm glad you are feeling better :)
That's amazing. I'm glad it was helpful and it's really crazy that you were able to meet people who benefitted from the study.
Thanks man, thats true first one is the hardest, I'm glad I came away with a good experience from it all. 
Thanks! It was a pleasure to make and I'm glad you enjoyed it!
I'm glad you think so.  It seems to be one of the fairest ways since they're equally random.
Whatever it is I'm glad it doesn't exist in real life [](/twinervous)
I'm glad I finally settled on gay. It makes a bit easier. I'll be adding you asap! 
[](/xx11)Hype~!Also I'm glad you linked the other thing, that was pretty cool too :P
Yeah sometimes I wish I could express myself like that to someone I love. I'm glad people like this song as much as I do :D Cheers!
I may have seen it and forgot cause that sounds familiar :p oh well, but I'm happy with the shield, I was able to add to it going with a similar style which is what I plan to do with my next project
No problem! I appreciate your consideration either way and I'm glad you were able to trade for what you want. Thanks and good luck to you too for any future trades!
why can't it be silent, like you have to listen to it to know when they're answering you so you can't not listen to that incredibly low bit rate shitI'm glad that when I was on centrelink I only ever had to ring them a few times
This is exactly what I was getting at lol I'm glad there are others that realize lol. Obviously, there will be some guns that are a little better (MW2) but in most games, all are usable. People keep talking about how there are only two guns that can be used in AW. I know AW is a little worse than others, but every gun is usable. Lol I'm glad you understand 
Ahahaha, yeah I'm glad you won't get piss on your cards as well :P
Your uterus must have been fed up with all their bullshit and decided "Okay, if these assholes aren't going to listen to the person I belong to telling them that I don't want to have a baby in me, I'm gonna find a way to peace the hell out of here."Somehow it feels wrong to congratulate someone for developing a condition that causes hemorrhaging, but in this case, it sounds like it worked out in your favor, and I'm glad you finally got what you wanted, albeit in a slightly different way!
You hit the nail on the head! I'm glad that we are stepping out of the submissive role women play. Its more socially acceptable for a man to choose not to have children, which is fine, but its just more difficult for women. I do believe in gender equality. I don't say the word feminism because of the bad name some people have given it, but I believe both parties should be free to choose.
I would basically agree with that. It's very different, and I'm glad 6 isn't as dark as 3 was.  And I do like Elroy and Frankie; I like that they're being used in different ways, not as replacements for the missing cast members. 
Well, if he ever tries to contact you in spite of the No-Contact order, and you can definitely prove it's him (general advice is to log all interactions, might be hard to prove it's him but if he keeps trying to bait you over a wide number of accounts I'm sure it can be done), then I'm sure there's something you'd be able to do. I'd ask the guys over in that subreddit I mentioned, because even though they can be abrasive, I've seen the advice they give as generally being solid.I'm sorry you're going through hell like this, and I really wish I could do more than offering light advice and words of encouragement. I'm glad you were able to get out of it, even though you're still dealing with the fallout.
Fuckin A guys! Thanks for the support! It feels weird to plug a band I'm in but I definitely want to spread it and I'm glad you guys dig it! 
I'm glad the repair worked :) 
Here's more info on those never-made books, from an interview of Lawrence Miles:Back in late 1998, while I was still working on INTERFERENCE, I was starting to think about what I might do next, and... I kind of went a bit overboard. I do that, sometimes, I just get horribly over-enthusiastic. I'd been into some bookshop or other, and I'd seen that the poxy Star Trek people were doing this mini-series of interconnected books inside the range, so there's this set of about six titles telling one great big story. Or something. And I was a bit hyper at this stage, so I thought, that's what I can do. I can write a series of half a dozen "maybe" books, about a potential future Doctor and a potential future Gallifrey. War and all. This was before I'd seen THE INFINITY DOCTORS, obviously. I thought, I can pitch them as one big six-book set, and then the BBC can put them out in the PDA slots or something... you can see how I was starting to go a bit funny, can't you?Anyway, the first story in this cycle was supposed to be called REQUIEM. So it's set on Gallifrey, but it's a version of Gallifrey that knows there's something bad coming, and it's starting to get paranoid and it's putting itself on a war footing. Then what happens is, this enormous artifact materializes in the sky over the Capitol. This huge, black, bone-like thing, which nobody can figure out and none of Gallifrey's people can get into. Everyone assumes it's some kind of enemy warhead, except that it doesn't attack, it just... sits there. Waiting. Then the Doctor arrives, and it turns out he's the only one who can get on board, because the artifact's directly linked to his destiny as well as the future that's bearing down on Gallifrey. Except that what he doesn't realize, until it's too late, is that he's being set up by Faction Paradox. The artifact mission's part of their plans for the Doctor's future, following the damage they did to his biodata in INTERFERENCE. You get the general idea. Stephen didn't respond to the idea very well, though. Probably because of the way I pitched it, I should think. I'm just astonished I was sober at the timeInfo on the never made Seconds book:SECONDS was rejected by Simon [Winstone?] at Virgin because he said it was too similar to CHRISTMAS ON A RATIONAL PLANET. He was wrong, mind you. THERE ARE WORSE THINGS THAN ANGELS was rejected by Nuala Buffini... she was Stephen's predecessor at the BBC... because she said it was "too garphic" for what they thought was going to be a family line, although she did say lots of nice things about it. ENDS was rejected by Stephen because it was supposed to be a sequel to ALIEN BODIES, and he thought it was too cosmic and gave too much away. THE SPECTACULAR AFTERLIFE OF BERNICE SUMMERFIELD was rejected because it was set thirty years in the Virgin series' future and was about Bernice's offspring. See what I mean about pushing my luck? THE WAR was rejected because... actually, I don't know why. Stephen never even bothered sending me a letter. I think he thought I was just taking the piss. And then there was VALENTINE'S DAY. The Dalek one. I think I deserve bonus points for not using the words "of the Daleks".Simon was wrong about SECONDS, certainly. It was nothing like CHRISTMAS, he'd just missed the point. It would've been a much better book than DOWN, without question, and it also would have been the first appearance of Faction Paradox. It was sort of supposed to be The Italian Job, with the Third Doctor leading this band of criminals on a raid to rob the Matrix tapes from Gallifrey. In the Whomobile. With little hover-pods instead of minis. On the other hand, I think Stephen was right about ENDS. And I'm glad ANGELS got rejected, because if I'd written it then I wouldn't have done ALIEN BODIES and I never would have figured out what I really wanted to do. Similarly, DEAD ROMANCE is probably better than SPECTACULAR AFTERLIFE would have been. But THE WAR would've been fun, I suppose. And I've got to admit, I'm still very sad that Justin turned down VALENTINE'S DAY. I always get very enthusiastic about a book when I start planning it out, but with VALENTINE'S DAY there was just so much I wanted to say, it was... well, I ended up plotting it out page-by-page, that's how stupidly full it would have been. It would've said everything I've ever wanted to say in a Doctor Who novel. But when you look back at your rejections, the worst thing is seeing the books that got commisioned in their place. Whatever Simon thought about SECONDS, surely it would've been better than A DEVICE OF DEATH? And wouldn't ANGELS have been better than THE EIGHT DOCTORS? Or how about ENDS and THE WAGES OF SIN? All I can say is, that book by Colin Brake next February had better be bloody good to beat VALENTINE'S DAY. And the Lumley one:it was supposed to be a story set on Earth during the Big Time Lord War, where history's come unstuck and all these alternate histories are overlapping. So you're never sure whether the Thirteenth Doctor's canonical or not, basically. My thinking was that BBC Worldwide would have the rights to merchandize thousands of old BBC programmes from the '70s and '80s, so what I wanted to do was go through the archives looking for all these old TV characters... most of them from sitcoms... and put them on Earth with the Doctor. There's this big concentration camp where the authorities put strays from other realities, so the Doctor finds herself couped up with all these fallen heroes from the BBC's past, and sharing a cell with Fletcher out of Porridge. The climax of the story was meant to be an assault on the Enemy's base, in which the Doctor and Captain Mainwaring out of Dad's Army lead a suicidal light-brigade assault across the final battlefield. Oh, and that was the other thing I was going to do. You know how in these war stories, one of the main characters is always a traitor working for the enemy army? In THE WAR, the traitor was going to be Mrs. Slocum's Pussy. Because it's a purely conceptual entity, it only exists in her head, and it turns out to be a Shift working for the Enemy. Like in ALIEN BODIES. 
I'm glad they have the same guy playing the xylophone.
Even though it's 2015, some lame people still have that stigma :(Aww that's great! I'm glad to hear your story anyway!
yeah I'm glad I was able to make you laugh (i'm not gonna ask what that bad moment was).Anyway, I only try to use smiley faces when I feel like something I say could be interpretted as rude or when I am trying to be nice/friendly. I don't get why people would hate that lol.Anyway, hopefully the downvotes stop :)
I understand what you mean ;-) but the purpose was to show the time spending to make a blade like this (3 to 4 days !). And the landscape and weather that they are facing during the winter ! Anyway, you liked the technical part, I'm glad ! 
&gt;stuff I do: - drinking every morningFor some reason I stopped reading here and thought *now here is a guy that likes to party!*Hey everything looks good!  I'm glad to see someone else who understands the power of audio books, time flies by when you're listening to them.
I'm happy that you go to Thailand. Maybe you can come to Isaan too :) There is my hometown. If you like my app, please rate it on play store! Khwanoi
No I'm happy to buy parts of anyone has them. Just want to know if anyone has any ideas or any old parts laying around that they would sell. 
This is when I'm glad I'm not a warming store. 
Lol, I'm glad I pass for Parting. Also, I think I'm actually mid/high masters now that they let the entirety of diamond in.Micro isn't actually that complex, I have my zealots hotkeyed to 2 and stalkers hotkeyed to 4 so it's not that hard to pick them all up into the WP. In the initial fight I was just clicking on the stalkers that were getting shot and putting them in the WP and then immediately D-clicking the WP to drop them. During the chase, I kept my mouse on the WP and unloaded with D-click and reloaded using my stalker hotkey.
I'm glad you left that relationship, no one deserves an abusive partner. I'm really sorry. But of course :) I think being single is fun, no obligations and stuff ya know?
I'm happy to upload them anywhere; I just don't have the means to host them. Let me know the how and where I'll start as soon as I can. Unfortunately, my original intent of finding the originals for ep 61+ doesn't seem to be panning out. 
Thanks for that. I'm glad it brings back some awesome memories :) That's how I feel when I go to Garner State Park. Me and my family would go camping there every year when I was younger. Oh so many good times.
Kennedy was an idiot though, warmongering asshole. I'm glad the fucker is dead. I wish more politicians would end the same way.
It is a tough decision to make, and I'm glad I have nothing to do with letting migrants into Europe but I agree with you. The less populated, richer countries of Europe, Scandinavia, Ireland, Switzerland etc. could definitely help a lot of these people. When I look around my house there is so much food, technology and other nice things that I have excess of. But on the other hand they don't speak European languages. This means that they can't get jobs and there is a limit to how much tax we are willing to pay for them.
I love my country and the culture but damn it we're messed up.I'm glad I got out of that hell hole.I'm definitely not coming back. Ever. My Mexico is a lawless country.Fuck that shit. I wanna be able to sleep at night, damn it.
Okay. According to the article, there was never any "law," let alone one that was passed. There was a proposed plan that died before it was ever implemented. Second, the plan didn't stop people from getting on buses, it put them on different buses from other people. Yes, that's segregation, and yes it's problematic which is why I'm glad the plan didn't move forward. But that doesn't change the fact that *your* racist narrative of what happened was, quite frankly, a lie.
"The Netherlands is a rare exception. In 2010, 54% of Dutch men were overweight, including 10% who were obese. These figures are projected to fall to 49% and 8% respectively. For women, the 2030 figures will be 43% and 9%, compared to 44% and 13% in 2010."I'm glad I'm Dutch... Are we the only people who know how to food? Even though those numbers are still way too high.. 
I'm glad to see you getting downvoted  for knowing what you are talking about, squid. http://thediplomat.com/2015/04/confirmed-china-deploys-new-carrier-killer-missile/
I'm glad you know what I'd do, and to compare the 2014 issues with the things that already have happened in Qatar (and they still have 7 years to fuck more things up) is so moronic that I don't want to talk to you.Not everything is about your stupid upvotes. But I get, you are very smart and very important and your morals are on point. And people really need to know that of course.
I'm glad we left in 1991.  During Gorbachev we actually believed in the future and said in 20 years Russia will be wonderful.  And here we are, a country for the few rich with a super corrupt despot of a government and poor, hungry citizenry.  
Yeah actually I'm happy enough to condemn ISIS's actions (you know, murdering and raping people) without knowing the exact details of the sexual act this poor woman refused before she got burnt alive. Disgusting.
I just did the one in Santa Monica last Saturday! I enjoyed the yoga and meditation, but the 5k surprisingly took place on the sand. It was difficult and annoying to run. Also, there were very few vendors there and I had expected food options for purchase. I'm glad the event wasn't too chaotic or crowded though; check-in and bag check went very quickly and smoothly. Overall I definitely enjoyed the experience and would participate again!
wow, theming looks great! I'm glad to hear that though, atleast the magnet won't be a huge concern then. 
This is great to hear :) Yay for good betas! I'm also having an u/s really early- I'm 4+6 today and having one Thursday at 5+2. I'm not really sure why the RE wants to do that, maybe because I have had a bit of spotting (although my betas were very good too)...? Please let me know how your scan goes and I will do the same! I'm glad to know from ladies on here that I shouldn't expect much from it. I'm guessing that the RE just wants to confirm location? 
Wow, what an event. I'm glad to hear you're both okay, I hope the feeding situation gets easier for you all soon.
I really appreciate all the great recipe posters here, and I have to say /u/botboy141 is my favorite. &lt;3I don't have a ton of time or energy to create and tinker with recipes and this subreddit is truly awesome for finding great recipes. ECF is such a cluster fuck for finding recipes and I'm glad that this subreddit has grown so much over the last year or so.
Thanks for the update. I'm glad that things worked out. :)
Thanks! Yeah, we could only send a few, but I'm glad they were good ones and we got some good answers out of Jon.
I'm glad you liked it :) 
I'm glad you guys had a good chat!  There's nothing worse than taking a verbal pummeling from your partner when they've hit the end of their ability to handle sleep deprivation.  I have been in your exact same shoes before.My son was an easy sleeper, but my daughter was NOT; it took her 10 months to sleep more than 3 hours at a time.What saved my wife's sanity was that I would try as MUCH as possible to keep the kids occupied and out of our room on Saturday and Sunday mornings, often allowing her to sleep in until 9:30-10:00am (which for us is crazy late).  I still do this more often than not, as I tend to be up 7ish on weekends.  I've usually got them fed, dressed or both.  Allows her to sleep off the stress of being a full-time mom.  And in return she usually doesn't complain when I go to play Destiny during my daughter's nap time on weekend afternoons.Keep talking; let her know which verbal blows hurt.  Even though it was likely sleep deprivation, it ALWAYS helps to have established lines that won't be crossed.
I was in your position, but I decided to take the jump and buy it, and I'm glad I did. I've been playing it all weekend, it's a lot of fun. 
Oh cool, thanks for the info guys. I'm glad I remembered that this sub existed, I was about to preorder the MP3 or cd. But now it's color vinyl all the way.
You missed one:“Do not allow a sorceress to live.” (Exodus 22:18) (or "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live" in KJV.)And it appears that you use context to argue a number of your points. I'm glad that you see that context is important. Now show me the context of the Quran quotes that show that they apply to modern Muslims.
That was a really hilarious misunderstanding and I'm glad it was corrected since that's an awesome way to create a relative safe space for your students, keep it up. 😊
Thanks for the info, I'll definitely have to keep my eyes open for one of those promo codes. I'm glad to hear that it runs better than Marvel Unlimited though, I always have issues with their app.
I am on suboxone at the moment so that eases the withdrawals. Last week I only used three days. I usually use everyday for two weeks and get to the point where I use to feel normal at the tail end and realize I gotta stop. I plan on getting off suboxone too. Opiated addiction ruined my life. I thought I could control it and I was even in love with the lifestyle.. but in reality it was all a poisonous black widow that made me numb to what mattered. My tolerance was so bad one time I went through a bunch of fentanyl and that was my second most recent relapse. It was horrible but I luckily have a fast metabolism so the w/ds don't stay too long. I do experience PAWS (post acute withdrawal syndrome) though and that really sucks cause it's when I'm a few weeks clean and I get cravings like crazy. I understand that it'll take a while for my mental and patiala state to recover completely. I am glad I am realizing that now. Before I never wanted to get clean and was doing it for others,But now I want to for myself. I will probably not go to a bar today then haha. I understand that it may be a bit awkward. I probably would not really enjoy it without good friends anyways. I am glad however I can go to some 21+ concert venues in the future :pAwesome advice man and glad you emphasize with y opiate addiction, ad sorry at the same time you had to go down that horrible cycle. I'm glad you got out, I know some people using 10+ years and they look miserable. Keep it up man. I will treat today just like any other day.
The rules of this forum state I can't "diagnose you," so I can't tell you if you have depression or not. I will say, however, that your symptoms line up, and I, having been diagnosed with depression, have experienced a lot of the feelings your having. I'm experienced hopelessness and worthlessness, and not just on occassion. While my depression is not at its worst right now, I still feel those feelings in the background *all* the time.If you are worthless and anxiety ridden every day, that is a signal that something needs to change, whether it's therapy or medication or just getting another job. So it's a sign that it's not just "a normal reaction to a bad situation." I felt so sad when I read about your experience at your 12-hour-shift job, and when I read about the knee situation. Those are such horrible situations to go through. I'm glad you recognize something is not right within you and are looking for solutions.
I'm glad you at least have your dad to talk to. Are you from Japan or just living there? I have no clue how to go about Skype therapy, and I'm not sure how it would work, but I know it's a thing. Since you live in Japan I'm not sure how that would work either, but it's worth looking into. I know a lot of doctors who do Skype appointments, and some therapists who do (in the town I'm from anyway), so I don't know if you would be able to get in contact with someone who is in another country or not. But I wanted to suggest it!
I'm glad you were able to find the right medications for you after all the hell those drugs put you through.
Thanks! The link gave me everything I wanted and more :DEdit: Wow, going back to the [support](http://serenesforest.net/blazing-sword/characters/supports/) page shows that some supports require 240 turns of standing next to each other total to get an A support... It's times like these I'm glad these support conversations are online. 
That was a great sushi commercial! I'm glad the Grumps are getting the whole entire $8 for that great ad! Really, one of the more entertaining live-action sequences :)
I'm happy with him if y'all are.
Thanks!"inverting the envelope" is a bit over my head right now, but I'm happy to understand the filter section a lot better.
OP, I feel for you. I went through some similar things when I still lived with my mom. That's been 15 years ago now, but it still sort of feels like yesterday. I remember it all vividly, and it still makes my heart thump a bit harder and faster thinking about it. Her and her boyfriend/husband would yell, beat the crap out of each other, break things, and generally do things which made for a scary environment. My room was in the basement and I would stay up listening to them through the vents above my room. I was so afraid I negotiated with a friend to buy an actual sword off of him and kept it in my room, along with several other home made weapons. I still have the sword. I thankfully never had to use them, as they very rarely took their fights down into the vicinity of my basement sanctum and seemed to be mostly happy taking out their aggression on one another, though my mom would turn on me sometimes. I never called the cops on them, mostly because I was scared to death to, and like your sister, I didn't really know what normal was or that this was something I could or should call the cops for. In hindsight I wish I had.I didn't have many friends, and I never really had the nerve to ask anyone for help. I had a couple of friends that let me stay the night on occasion, and one of them, the one I bought the sword from, had parents that seemed to be aware of what was going on in my house, though I don't recall telling them. They fed me dinner a few times when I wouldn't have otherwise gotten it. But, other than that, I was on my own.I guess what I'm saying is that reading your story reminded me of the similar crap I went through. Obviously there were some differences in my case, but a lot of it really reminded me of my time under my mom's roof. So, to some extent, I know what it's like. It sucks, and so few really understand. I'm glad you found at least one person there who cares. It really can make all the difference.
I'm glad you enjoyed the pictures, forgive a little shameless self promotion, but if you would, feel free to share on whatever social media you have. There's no money in this, so I do it solely for the attention. ;) Anyhow, I know what you mean about paying the high costs to live in Lawrenceville...I lived there for two wonderful years, but have since moved to cheaper, more spacious environs. Still, I grew up in Pittsburgh and I understand the deep, exciting allure of the neighborhood. I was sent to Washington Education Center when I was a kid for Occupational Training twice a month (something I wish schools would bring back), and the place always seemed so intense and thriving to me; I just wanted to explore every inch of it. I'm glad I got to live there, but as I get older, the intensity of Lawrenceville gets to be a bit too much for me personally to think about permanently settling down there. In my heart, however, Lawrenceville will always be one of my favorite places on the Planet.  
I understand the problem with reflections, and to mitigate those I was going to build small frames maybe 2' by 3' and 1" thick, put a thin piece of foam inside, and cover them with black fabric to mount on the walls. I'm glad you said something about that though, because that's another thing to add to the list! The speakers will be mounted on articulating mounts and be aimed at the couch I'll sit on most often :)The ceiling will be black, and potentially the wall the screen is on. I prefer the red, but it will be a dull red, either satin or flat to reduce glare. The circuit breaker panel I will cover with some homemade "NOW SHOWING" signs that I'll make out of posters of my favorite movies, and just hide it under one of them. /u/threeclaws I was considering putting the sub in the risers, but I'm not sure. It was an idea I threw around a few months ago to battle space limitations, but since the room is pretty big I think it'll be fine under the end table.  And as for having the money-- I just bought this house, so money is wrapped up with a dozen other projects going on at once :)Thanks guys!
I stopped by on Friday. I thought they were pretty fun and I'm glad they're filling in the empty storefronts. That part of the city has such potential that's being wasted. The vendors were just ok, but I'd say they're worth checking out. 
Thanks for the reply, I think I will put it off until spring or summer. I'm glad 50-70 usd sounds realistic...I know western Europe is incredibly expensive, and I was hoping the countries I'd picked out would be more affordable. As for the safety precautions, good to know. I've solo travelled South America- hopefully I can bring back that level of paranoia and stay safe!
If that mean's futuristic, thank you.  I was just trying to get some kind of organized, chaotic structure going at first.  As I went though, it started to go another way. A high-speed information highway in a supercomputer, or something...  That's the way I tried to play it up anyways.  I'm glad people like it anyways.
It's not a problem. Just trying to use that negative energy for something more positive! :)Sounds like a busy day. I'm glad the group is helping! I love stuff like that because you always, well I always at least, leave feeling so much better. Gym is fun! Do you have a workout you do or is it just a bit of everything? Fingers crossed!Love the attitude and I'm proud of you for eating healthy and working out! Keep it up!
I'm glad you joined!
Prison should be reform, not punishment. Punishing people doesn't achieve anything except feelings of revenge. Reform gives people the ability to change into functional members of society. This should be done on a case by case basis. Simply saying that if you take a life you don't deserve one is a comically simple and naive way to look at the judicial system. I'm glad people like you aren't in charge...&gt;I feel the same way about crimes that hurt other people, you no longer are a part of the group normal people are once you hurt someone else on purpose.You must lead a sheltered and safe life to never have felt like hurting another person. Most people are not as privileged. 
As someone who never uses zip ties, I'm glad this concept is scalable to other types of packages. Thanks OP!
I'm glad it isn't. It's embarrassing seeing our fans pulls the knives out despite many still having traces of Rodgers' semen still on their lips from last season.
The fact we're 98% not getting top four, I'm happy to let Gerrard play every minute he has left. Season is basically over, let sentimentality rule haha
My space is super tidy! I mentioned I have a very short fuse when it comes to her and this is because growing up in a house with her was not at all easy and it frustrates me because it is just so easy for me to be tidy.My mother isn't exactly like what you see on those hoarding shows, but it just frustrates me that when she collects MY trash, she's becoming more and more like the individuals on the shows.I guess my guilt from tossing my things elsewhere could also be associated with the guilt I feel in general for her. I guess it is more pity for her, actually.I want to try and talk to her but I don't know if I should start with, "if you don't stop going through my trash I will throw my trash away elsewhere" or, "mom, I see you've been going through my bin. The things in there are, in fact, in there for a reason. You can hold on to as much stuff as you like, but you can NOT keep the stuff I want to get rid of."I don't want to hurt her feelings but I'm kind of upset with her. I want to be firm, but not make her feel like she really fucked up. :(That turned into a mini vent fairly quickly! Thank you for your advice! This sub is so wonderful, I'm glad to see ladies being so supportive of each other.
Well, In any case I'm glad you posted. I had originally bought them for my 7mm motors... I guess Ill just have to settle for some 8mm FPV fun ;-) Also, now that the Parrot has been fed, maybe we can see if the elusive Alien will make another landing... Just mindless thought. Pay me no attention :-)
Glad you liked it. You put a lot of thought into a blind trade and I'm glad I was able to make someone happy. 
I know this is a little late, but hopefully you'll read this. First off, I hope your mom had a great Mother's Day. Secondly, I'm glad you went to church. She wanted to share something that is meaningful and special to her with you and your brothers whom she loves very much. You can still be an atheist and go to church for a special occasion. I grew up in a Catholic family wherein religion plays a huge part of our culture so for occasions like that I chalk it up to something cultural and just grin and bear it. There are still many tenets of Catholicism, namely charity, humbleness and a spirit of brotherliness that resonate with me despite my lack of belief.
Well, I'm glad you liked the surprise. And let's add more affordable than Lush ;P
Sweet! I'm glad you liked it!
*hugs* I'm glad you're getting help. I hope things are better in the long run.
Actually I'm horrible...theres a lady with a username of wine queen who is from Monroe lolol woops..i missread your name. But yep I'm over in Haughton really..but I always say Shreveport. That's awesome! I'm glad there are more. Found one last night who is a friend of my bff. :D small world
It's ok, it's a minimap from 1998. It was strictly designed with the intention of clarity. In fact, I'd argue that's why Brood War caught on as one of the first ESports. Sure the skill ceiling was ridiculously high, and the better player almost always won, but you could always tell what was going on, what was going to happen and who was winning. The kind of pseudo-2D perspective Starcraft gave was so vivid for a spectator, that even with perfect information and a fraction of a grasp of mechanics that the pros had, you could get excited watching it. Plays would be made right in front of the opponent that they could do nothing about, and I think "starsense" was coined from watching pros predict certain moves of others.Such a lovely game, I'm glad I got to experience it's lifespan from start to finish.
I'm glad that i'm an asshole then.Cause it's literally ZERO fun playing against those decks. Facehunter completely ignores you and Grim Patron punishes you for playing the game.I feel sorry for those who play those decks.
I'm glad to hear such a helpful answer from an experienced person. I'll definitely think about this.
I'm glad you think that way.
I'm glad it wasn't in Brazil, bro, if you're mugged here and you refuse to give your stuff they just straight kill you. Poor law system...
Yup most definitely, have been at willow springs to drive a few times it's very fun and I'm glad I only live 15 miles away :)
Then let's initiate Turner. I'm glad this turned out this easy 
I really enjoy his work so far! And I'm glad I can still trust my ears. ;)
Dang I'm sorry it was that bad. For the majority it does not seem to be a big deal. I wonder if there's something about your anatomy they were not sensitive to, such as the direction/curve of your cervix or something. Either way I'm glad you got good results, at least.
They are good together. I'm glad they are friends considering they took a similar path to get to where they are. Just Nick and Disney are rivals.
I'm glad that I had one relationship in my life when I was 25, if not I probably would have done the same thing at 30. Although to be honest, I never gave suicide any thought until that relationship ended.I'm 35 now and I'm fine with my FA status for like 90% of the time.
It Looks great! I'm glad I could help you, very nice stitching for your first project too. Now burnish those edges!
Indeed. I'm glad these guys reconciled after twenty five years of feuds and misunderstatements. Damn, this was an intense chapter all around!
I'm on mobile and I'm glad you did this.
And I'm glad for the both of you, he needed a good friend and I think he found one. ^(I just hope he doesn't screw this up)   
"That...that's fantastic." she smiles a little, "I'm glad you and your sister are sorted. That's really good."
"I'm glad you think so. It's a lot of fun for me to do, so I do it a ton."
*Ruby smiles as Story leans in*  Yeah of course I'm happy, I have no reason not to be.
hey there,I'm truly sorry that things are shitty right now. I'm sorry that they've been shitty for a while. you've come a long way, and I'm glad you decided to post on here. I understand your situation - sometimes we're simply unable to really *look* at life. it can be anything, really. whatever you've been going through, I am sure it's been hell. but I wanted to let you know that I think there is an exit out of this too. maybe it'll lead you to more hardships, sure. who knows what life has in store for us? as cliché as this sounds: where there's darkness, there's also light. sometimes it's hard to keep the will to keep going, to keep searching for that light. but I hope you trust and believe me when I say: it can be worth it. sometimes it doesn't feel like it. but there are moments that sometimes show you that it'll be okay. somehow.it sucks that there's no one you can talk to. I'm willing to listen. and talk with you. if you want to.. if not, that's okay too. I just want to let you know that I do understand. if there's a part of you missing it's really fucking difficult to keep on walking. maybe there's a way out there though. you have to find it within yourself. wherever or whoever you are, I hope you'll keep that little hope to find your way out of this. once you start *seeing* again, it'll probably be easier.. if you want to talk, I'm here to listen. you can also PM me. don't let this be your last week. 
Great news, OP. I'm glad to see you going on to better places. Don't give up this newfound passion for life. There's a lot more to do out there, don't give up! 
I'm glad you saw the issue in that and also saw realization of the pain you would've caused others. It's a matter of people that you talk to that will tell you things on a different tone. I understand and can relate to your need for your substance and the feelings you get with it is just something you'll understand yourself while others might not get it, believe me I've been there a few times before. But it's also not a decision of either your happiness or your parents. Your way to young to think it's all way to tough already, there is still much to experience. Glad to hear that as you said yourself, I hope you accomplished something.As someone who has done things before so I'm commenting from experience in the past I'll just say, if you feel happy and think that weed is for you then by all means stick with it, however don't jump onto other drugs that are more stronger or effective or to say the most suicide just because you can't get to weed.  That's not how you should try to clear things up or make your life easier. There's no need for sorry or apology, you come here seeking advice and I'm just being straight forward with you :)
You're saying a medium should *NEVER* be able to fight a heavy head on? I'm glad you aren't part of the balancing team. 
And i said I'm happy being 15 stone and 10% bodyfat... Doesn't mean i don't wanna be 16 and 7% thought does it? 
Me too, we lost so many people though... but we survived! And I'm glad I know people of the same age as me.
So long as I dont have to do one, I'm happy.
I can understand that. Half the time I want to strangle you, but I'm glad we're friends! 
*hugs tighter giving hee cheek a nudge* Hehe I'm happy to see you of course! 
I'm glad you found it funny.
I have a g5 case, actually. Been trying to get rid of itPerhaps /u/ihaveb4lls or /u/cribbit could help out with shipping? If they're willing, I'm happy to work with you on price 
I'm glad I could help! I ran into the same issue when I bought my 980. I was worried the performance was not what I thought it was XD
I admire the scope and extension of the universe the prequels brought, and I loved them when I was a kid, but looking at them now they're all piece-of-shit films, while Episode III is just an okay film, I can call myself a fan because I live for the charm and simple joy the OT provides, something which cannot be said of the prequels. I'm glad they exist, but God I wish they weren't shit.
I just ordered this keyboard off a Fry's sale, too bad its backordered and it'll probably be a little while until it ships. But for 80 bucks I'm happy with waiting.
Well that's good to hear! I'm glad that's the case
The hyphen in "dadbod-hairy" was supposed to be a break to a new clause. But thanks for the reply! I'm glad you liked it!
I'm glad you're here.
Congrats on your two days! I am in college as well, and I'm happy to be done with finals!
I could see it being played with a controller but just keyboard sounds kind of like a hassle. If this is the case then I'm glad mouse support is being added. xD;
I put off going to my counselor for a long time. I'm glad I finally went. 
No problem. I'm glad I could help out. I saw a Black one go for 70 bucks on eBay with literally no accessories. It's nuts. 
I don't need them, remember? And at least I'm happy. :)
Before I met my fiancée 6 years ago, I tried the Internet dating thing. It's ridiculous how pissed some girls get at you. I wrote specifically on my profile that I didn't want to date a girl with kids and one chick messaged me and bitched me out about it calling me a shallow prick, among other things. Another girl I went on a date with, didn't really feel it and when I told her over the phone next time we spoke, she proceeded to tell me what a worthless piece of shit I am. I'm glad I got myself a unicorn because some of those women are fucking crazy. 
I'm glad you decided that for them.
Well, that's just people who don't understand critique! I'm getting my PhD in English and I also critique the books I'm studying (which includes pointing out what aspects of them are problematic) but it's to reach a greater understanding of them. I haven't seen much of Anita's work but I have never heard of her being a kind of "don't play this game" person, more of a "we're all playing this game together, so let's think about what that says about us as a culture, and whether we should want better." That simple thought process is essentially what I try to get my students to do in Intro to Writing, so it's hard for me to see it as that dangerous or revolutionary.Either way I'm glad that we can understand each other :D
Those people were all barbaric and fucked up. I don't know what's natural about a huge group of people kicking the shit out of a girl and then setting her on fire. Street justice isnt always a bad thing, but some of those sick fucks looked like they enjoyed it. God I'm glad I wasn't born into that garbage 
You are still developing your supply, so when it's possible - if you can - try to nurse any time you get a chance. That will help your breasts learn they need to make more! I'm glad you found out not to use nursery water to dilute your milk. If you simply can't nurse as often as you'd like and baby needs more sustenance, it's better to fill in the gaps with formula or donated milk from another mama. Nursing is absolutely a supply/demand system, so nursing really is the best way to increase your supply. Every drop of breast milk you give your baby is gold, and you've done an awesome job for four weeks! I applaud your persistence! Get lots of rest, drink plenty of water, and do what's right for your family. Congratulations on your baby girl! 
Yeah, I'm glad we already have a conflict on that date and could not attend. Traveling to Berkeley to see the game would be pure hell. There is nothing worse than trying to get to that area, and on a weeknight it is a joke to think it is even possible from many areas in the region.
A very interesting theory! I'm glad you posted with some real, workplace insight. To be completely honest I wanted my theory to be debunked. I think star wars will be better without a second ship.
Thanks for the reply. I was a bit worried that I wrote all that and you wouldn't see it, since you deleted the original question. If possible, get out of your small town and move somewhere with more of an artistic scene. If that isn't possible, try to get out of the small-town mentality and find some online friends who share your interests. The reality is that most people in your small town aren't likely to find out what you do if you don't tell them, especially if they don't have much interest in art, or pursuing art online. I personally left my small town in order to get away from people who were too close-minded. Now I have friends who have a wide variety of interests. I know several females who write erotica, erotic fan fiction, and even have published erotic graphic novels. Here in Las Vegas some of my neighbors are strippers and I talk to them like anyone else. There's a part of the world that's a lot less judgmental than you think. Just be aware of the people you are talking to and if they would be OK with it then you can be open about it. Also, I'm glad your art style is far from manga. Everyone is copying that style now, but the art that really stands out is the art that does its own thing. Also, gang bang and bestiality (in the furry variety at least) is actually fairly "average" when it comes to erotica online, where you can find some of the most obscure fetishes possible thanks to rule 34. So while I may be a bit more open-minded that most guys, I really don't think I'm that rare either in that respect. I guess my best advice would work as life advice in general: Find the people, places, and state of mind that makes you a better and happier version of you. 
And this is why I'm glad the sraw is getting nerfed. Killing enemies from this distance should be reserved to snipers, not engineers.
That's awesome! I'm glad you found it useful. :)
At least I'm happy that the state I was born in and the state in which I currently reside are not on this list.
That's so cool! I'm glad the tutorial helped!!
What happened to the theme on episode 5? I applaud the experimentation but I'm glad that only lasted one episode.
Why thank you! I'm glad you enjoyed :)
&gt; and I listened to this in public. crosses legs, and bites lipsAnd I have a thing for turning someone on in public and them not being able to do anything about it...*adjusts tie*I'm glad you like it! Hopefully you get the chance to more thoroughly enjoy it. ;)
I'm glad you enjoyed hearing it as much as I enjoyed receiving them! 
Hehe thank you. I'm glad you enjoyed it :)
What a way to start the day. I'm glad I checked reddit. :-)
Nah, fuck him. I'm glad I ruined his marriage. 
I'm glad it went through and any time.
Well I'm glad we were able to move over at least those three. :) 
Haha thanks, I'm glad you think so :]
Yeah I thought that might be the case. I'm happy to do the 2 arceus for that spread then. 
It might be, though generally I think if you live a well rounded life in most aspects it tends to even itself out and stay where it's supposed to be. That being said, not many people can find time to meditate for as long as necessary to balance out their horrifically stressful lives/families/jobs/etc or exercise as often as they should or sleep perfectly etc etc.My source for that is that after coming out of an eating disorder my body found where it was supposed to be and stayed there after I started just caring about sleep/water/specifically doing meditative activies to control for anxiety/stress, etc. I'm glad you're okay! I hope you stay okay and your grandpa backs off; it's frankly sort of weird and creepy that he's so concerned with other peoples' bodies?
I think it's part of the reason I'm delaying this break up so much. I don't know how I'll feel with someone else.Honestly, I think if I was in her place, I would do the same. Even though I love her, the thought of seeing someone else and having fun isn't a bad one. And having those thoughts make it that much harder to cut the cord. Anyway, I just messaged her. We're talking tonight. She was a bit dry, didn't try to comfort me or anything. Honestly, sometimes I think she's just trying her best to make it easy for me, and I'm glad for that. Well, we will see how things go tonight.
I did consider that, but those of us on leases can't just move as we please.  Plus I'm happy with where I'm at.
Ah cheers man!! I'm glad haha, you should totally get back into it!
Thanks man I really appreciate that information. I'm glad that study was done. He definitely deserved that medal just as much as anyone else.
I'm a feminist and think domestic violence against men (and how incorrectly and frankly inhumanely it's handled by law enforcement and the justice system) is one of the major social issues of our time. I do try to talk about the issues whenever something related comes up, and I'm glad that in my country there are at least a few organizations/bureaus that men can turn to and find support, but I feel like it's something that's not in the general public's field of awareness yet (the support groups are mainly local/small and academic studies few and far between).
**Farmer:**  So Bessie, you know your child who was stillborn?**Cow:**  Yes, I was sad, but now I've come to accept it.  I've decided to move on...**Farmer:**  GOOD NEWS!  I have brought your baby back to life with the miracle of science!  Take a look.**Cow:**  OH MY GOD!  Why is Dawn's child wearing the skin of my baby!?!**Farmer:**  Dawn's dead!  And this is your child, not Dawn's.  Better take good care of her, because she's your child, right?**Dawn's Child:**  B... Bessie, I'm scared.  Farmer took my mom away, and dressed me up in this.  Please help me.*&lt;Bessie is freaking out inside, but too scared to make a sound&gt;***Farmer:**  I'm glad you agree Bessie.  Give her lots of milk.  You don't want your child to end up like Dawn, now do you?
Since boxing is a dying sport, I'm glad he made hi money while he could.
I can, with great confidence, say that this dude's life isn't worth shit after he shot a baby in the fucking face in front of its mother. But I'm glad ASOIAF has given you a reasonable justification to defend this dude, maybe you're more enlightened than I am. I'll still take a world in which this guy doesn't exist. 
I'm glad he recovered from that and is still going in the NHL.   I watched his college career at Ferris State, he made an excellent captain.
I'm glad to know I'm not the only one!
She is very much one of my favorite artists. and I'm glad to see her recognized here!
I'm glad you posted this, I was looking at her store earlier but didn't know what to think due to not that much feedback
I've thought about this same thing for a while now but just from a different perspective--I'm glad to see there are metrics to support it.  I've played as a Titan since launch and, while I still thoroughly enjoy punching things to death, I am completely underwhelmed with both Titan subclass supers. I'd say that at times I am completely frustrated with the high fail/miss rate of my Fist of Havoc. (I'm sure it's just "Operator Error")The hunter has the ability to bladedance around and easily kill 3-5 players when in Crucible--especially when  playing Control where enemies are bunched/bottlenecked more frequently.  The Gunslinger(Golden Gun) gives you ridiculous range with your Super and can easily OSK 2-3 enemies with your Super.   A Voidwalker (I'm assuming they are Voidwalker--I don't play as a warlock) gets a distance Super and can easily 3-5 with their Novabomb.   TL;DR:  I agree that the Hunters' Super seems to be OP for PvP.  I think that there could be some work done on the Titan Striker Super (Fist of Havoc) due to it's higher fail/miss rate.
Which is another reason I'm glad we're being allowed to farm. It's a pain in the ads to go through that only to miss the chest because you can't find it.
*"and others rarely have issues aside from a few glitches in the raids and Iron Banner."*I'm glad you don't experience many errors, but perhaps don't speak for everyone else. In the early days of Destiny (first week or two) I was getting booted from nearly *every* match. I had the zoo of errors, and despite my best efforts, it would continuously boot me. As with OP, I only ever had issues with Destiny. Nothing else was having connectivity problems.For the most part things are better, but there are still days where Destiny will just go full-idiot and give me errors out the ass. And if you paid enough attention to this sub and to the forums, you'd see there are plenty of *other* people with connection problems as well.Again, I'm glad your experience has been shiny and wonderful, but that's not the case for everyone, and in general it *is* Destiny's fault. Certainly there's something about our connections that interacts with Destiny in a funny way, resulting in the errors, but that's just it... it's only Destiny. Whatever is "wrong" with my connection, it only ever fucks with Destiny.To me, that means Destiny is the problem. Whatever the problem is, it clearly doesn't affect users such as yourself, but that doesn't mean it's not there.
You really think so?  I'm glad they didn't come out too bobbleheaded
I'm glad I wasn't that unlucky and only had one match where the opposing team were all red bars and we were greenthe amount of teleported fists of havoc was unreal 
I too am very miffed at elemental primary weapons behind behind a PvP wall. And not just a PvP wall, a fucking ridiculous wall. I know I'm not very good, and I'm glad PvP has a real, outstanding endgame, but damn. At what cost, yo?
No worries. I'm not a fan of jumping to conclusions either. If I had meant the threat was from them I'm glad someone would have called me out on it. 
I'm glad tying a bio degree.  I had just finished my third year of pharmacy school when I decided to switch, so even though it is a general biology degree it has a focus on health sciences.  In the fall I'm going to grad school for my masters in nursing.  I'm super excited about it!  =)
OOC: *dying* ____________________________ *Beroe nods off and takes a large monstrous bite out of her pizza cone. What a cute couple.* "Yeeah, right. The camp needs to have *siesta* time or something like that.* *Then, just like him, she takes another large bite out of her pizza cone and licks the cheese trails on her fingers.* "Wow, I'm glad they serve pizza!" 
I have my own occasional hissyfits about reposts, so I'm not even trying to shit on you, but you've gotta just move on with your life.  I spend an ungodly amount of time on Reddit and I hadn't seen this before.  AND it gave me a gentle chuckle, so I'm glad it was posted.
Well, the only person I am likely to be able to hug is my wife and I'm guessing she isn't you, but I'm happy to do it anyway if that helps.And an electronic hug of course: &lt;hug /&gt;
Thanks! I'm glad you enjoyed, means a lot.
Thank you, I'm glad that you enjoyed it. :)
Ok, so this wasn't as much fun as we thought it would be. Man, the whole space travel thing is so overrated. First weeks were really cool, though. You wouldn't believe the number of stupid stunts and pranks it's possible to pull out in zero gravity. Even better, most of the pranks were at the expense of Mark. Ahah what a nerd this one, I'm glad we took him with us.But yeah, after a while it gets old. It's so frustrating to be stuck in this thing all the time with nothing to do. The two girls didn't buy into our attempts to turn this into some kind of orgy. We tried to go with the novelty aspect of zero gravity, the survival of the human race in case Earth implodes while we're out here, the last chance to feel some comfort before we hit a meteorite, and so on.Well, nothing worked... what with their little boyfriends back home and all. So boring. Anyway, now we spend most of our time playing TES12 on the main computer. Good thing is Mark managed to hack into the mod server, so we can get any of them for free. Takes several days to download anything though, with our shitty connection to earth.Oh, what is this ? Mark do you see ? Where does it come from ?&gt; --- I WOULDN'T GO FURTHER IF I WERE YOU ---It's an external transmission ? Not from base ?  What the hell ? There shouldn't be anyone in range. Do they have an identification number ?  Wait, there's another one.  &gt; --- ALIENS ARE GOING TO BITE YOUR SWEET LITTLE AMERICAN ASSES --- Whaaaaaaaaaaaat ?  Can you repeat the last three digits of their ID code ?   &gt; --- WE'LL BE THERE FIRST YOU PUSSIES ARE GOING HOME SECOND ---Ahahahahah, Kovalyov, you douchebag !!  Mark, disable the autopilot and all security controls, we're gonna speed up the pace. Now *this* is going to be fun.
Part II let the shop door slide shut, tickling the bell. A sign reading closed hung in the window. I whistled as I turned the key, unaware that I would soon convince a man to die. Orange afternoon sun bled through the Boston skyline while I did a final survey of the coffee shop. A hulking glass building was plopped on top of my humble business, almost as if it would be crushed at any time. A sudden pitiful noise pierced the lukewarm fall air, coming from an adjacent alleyway; a low whimper, like a wounded dog. Curious, I decided to investigate. I could hear the shuffle of a jacket against pavement and shoes raking the sidewalk. When I turned the corner, there was a long figure slumped against the textured brick wall. His pale skin interrupted the alleyway shadows. Not having seen me, he let out a long sob, which rose sharply when he inhaled. I came to a halt about two meters away. “Are you okay?” I said, tentatively. Startled, he rolled around to face me. Making an effort to smother his tears, he spoke.“I think you know the answer,” he sputtered. Sniffing a few times, he dragged himself up and sat against the wall, staring hard at nothing in particular. The opposite building's exhaust poured out of pipes in the wall, swirling around us in a white haze.“Do you need somewhere to stay? I've got some space in my apartment if you don't mind sleeping on a couch,” I suggested. Usually I try and help the homeless people who hung out by the shop, but his leather coat and new shoes didn't scream 'needy'.“I've got a home. And a wife. And a daughter,” he told me, which must have been a sore subject because he flew into another bout of tears. Burying his face in his hands, he shook his head with grief.“How about we come inside?” I pointed to the door, producing my keys.--------------------“I'm David. You?”“Call me Chronie.” His voice was a sad vibrato, wavering uncertainly. I set a steaming cup of hot chocolate on the table. The city descended into shadows outside the window in darkening shades of turquoise. He blew into his third tissue, blinking heavily. I sat down facing him, though his eyes were fixed on an analog clock hung on the wall; it was a quiet metronome, adding tempo to the silence. The man was in his middle ages, nearing six feet tall. He had a sort of extinguished glow on his face, like he had been happy for every moment besides the present. I broke the “Is there anything you need?”“You can't do anything for me. Nobody can,” he said hoarsely. I decided he was being a touch dramatic, because that sounded like something my fourteen-year-old daughter would say.“Okay… and why's that?” I wondered aloud.	He let out a sad chuckle from his gut and said, “Long story, David. It's not very believable either; I can hardly believe it myself.” There was no turning back now-- he was going to tell me. What was this mysterious event that caused him so much grief?“I've got all night. Tell me.”“Well I've only got about an hour left, so I'll make it quick,” he said, to my confusion, glancing at the clock for what must've been the hundredth time. He stretched and settled into his chair, placing his forearms on the tablecloth. The shop's lights, which fought the descending darkness, buzzed above our heads. “It's gonna storm soon.” He said, absentmindedly. “The meteorologists didn't predict it, but I know it will. There's gonna be a loud lightning strike at about ten-o-three.” He looked at the clock again, which read 9:15. This is gonna be interesting, I thought.“And how do you know this exactly?”“I'll explain,” he answered. “I was twelve the first time I reset.”“Reset? You mean, like, a computer reset?”“Yeah. Something along those lines. Though back then I had never even used a computer. I kinda just assigned the name after thirty years of doing it.” He almost seemed calm for a moment, temporarily losing himself in previous years. “Anyway, my twelve-year-old self had just professed love for his crush right in front of her. She swiftly rejected me in the classic Middle School way: publicly and loudly. In embarrassment, I fled, retreating to a classroom bean bag chair. As I curled up, I wished with all my being that I hadn't done that. I could have just gone the entire day without ever saying anything. She would have been perfectly happy, and I would still have an unlikely fantasy. That's when I woke up. In my bed, at my house, at six thirty in the morning.” He looked me in the eyes, and I could tell that he was being completely serious. Of course, being serious and being truthful can be very different things. “Are you with me David? You look confused.” I was. “Well let me tell you what, twelve-year-old me was twelve times more confused. First I yelled in shock. I looked around me. It was definitely my room. My mother's voice called from the stairs, 'Chronie, don't forget to take the last of your pills. I'm glad you're finally done with those things.' The weird thing was that I had already taken that last pill. I got out of bed and sure enough, there was a single pill sitting in the CVS container. The doctor said it was for my nighttime terrors.”“Hold up, are you saying the pills had something to do with the occurrence?” I interrupted.“It was a weird coincidence, but I still have no idea why it happens,” he said with a shrug. I noticed the man had become tighter, lowering his head and shrinking back in his seat. He would sweep the room with his eyes, which would stop on the clock and then return to my eyes. Thunder rolled in the background, and rain tapped the windows.“You mean this happened more than once?”“Yup – I'll get to that part. I had gone back in time. Back to the beginning of the day. It scared me at first, but little by little I realized what it had done for me. My crush continued to not know I existed that day, and for the first time I was glad. Had it all been a dream? The next week, I tried it again. By closing my eyes and focusing hard, when I'd open my eyes again, it would be morning again. But I could only go as far back as the last time I woke up. Every time I went to sleep, I limited the time I could relive. I could take risks; risks I would never be allowed to take otherwise. I went from being the really shy person to a more outgoing and popular guy. I refined the ability until I could restart the day without even blinking. In High School I had more relationships than anybody, because who's afraid of asking someone out if you can reset? Of course, there were more uses than just that – eating five doughnuts in the morning and not living with the stomachache, seeing every movie without spending a single dollar, memorizing exams, and plenty of other shenanigans. I lived a life without consequences, which I now have to face.”“Did you go skydiving without a parachute?” I wondered.“Ha, no. I'm not very fond of heights. But the best part? I met a beautiful woman who wanted to be my wife. She's got brown skin, like yours.” I looked down at my hands in my lap, as if I didn't know I was Indian. He let out what started as a laugh, but died into a groan when he looked at the clock. The hands had shifted their way to 9:45. He started breathing harder. “Today was like any other Saturday. I got up and did what ever the hell I did the first time around.”“So you've lived this day multiple times,” I concluded.“You have no idea,” he huffed, putting his head in his hands.“Well, why this day in particular?”
Thank you, for the kind words. I'm glad that you enjoyed the story.
First thoughts:* I'm glad that they brought back certain stealth elements like removing the hard cover lock and letting us whistle.* ~~I'm slightly more optimistic because Ash Ismail is the director, and he did a good job with Black Flag.~~* Normally I like a good romance, but since Ubi has a tendency to kill off love interests, I'm glad of the focus to a brother-sister dynamic. * That Indian assassin looks badass.* I like the emphasis on smaller weapons, but I really hope they let us use that sword-cane as a more traditional option. Love sword-canes!* ~~I desperately hope they don't *make* us use multiplayer to advance our single-player capabilities. I want **REPLAY VALUE**~~ Apparently there won't be any multiplayer. I don't mind.* Please please don't let the plot be shit, please don't let the plot be shit.
I'm glad to do it.
Thanks, I am actually feeling a lot better about things after a couple of months. My boss told me the other day he is very impressed by how quickly I picked everything up so I'm happy!
Thanks for the feedback. The fish has been labeled by many as being to quick, so I'm glad you are validation that concern. Also thanks for the bug. I haven't seen it happen before, so I'm grateful you've discovered it for me.
I'm glad you were able to find them.
Right???!?  I'm glad someone else understands my rage.
I agree that it's strange if this is how it was broken. I'd have thought that you'd have gotten round to killing this particular group eventually and that would have fixed things. Maybe it was just a bug in this case. Anyway I'm glad it's working now.
Sure it's all you. I'm happy to share the gold with yall supports on that cannon minion.But if you miss it there's a top laner who can treat me real good
I'm glad he brought up the variance, because the sample size in football is so small compared to other sports (the team with the highest number of TDs last year had 58) that you can't just base the plays on expected value and expect a long-term regression to the mean like you can in baseball.When dealing with sample sizes that small it can often rationally be better to go with a lower expected value that also has a lower variance.
*He smiles, opening the door for you and nodding.*Well, I'm glad.
Why thank you. I'm glad you were safe. ~~Save me from Maria.~~
It's been on my wish list for so long and I'm glad I finally got it. Let me know how it works out for you if you decide to check it out!
I'm glad. Let's make it happen 
Ahahaaha no no it's totally fine! I totally set up the joke for that one with my title haha, but thank you so much! I'm happy you like it! :)
I'd advise against using toggle slow walking or crouching.  As for keybinding slow walking, either use shift or ctrl. Depends on your preference. Same with crouching.  If u have any other questions feel free to PM me, I'm glad to help people willing to learn the game :).
I love this movie. I'm glad this trend of Kingsman gifs is happening.
Fun, no.  But doable.  My basement is 20x40 with an 8' foundation wall... about half the floor and 3/4 of the walls were covered in some very stubborn paint.  Took a couple of days, but I'm glad I did it.
Wow the guy in that house is heartless. I'm glad all the pups seem to be okay.
Thank you for your kind words!! I have lived too long hiding myself, and who cares, it's a throwaway anyway. Why lie?So, today, I walk with the Lord, serving him, doing whatever I can to glorify him -I'm actually actively serving the church.I am not married, which is good. I have discovered over the past several years that the rottenness I have carried within my heart has taken a long, long time to heal. I have had to do serious introspection and prayer, looking to figure out why I'm so messed up, and what to next do. So I'm glad, but hopefully God'll send her soon!And my last PMO (ever?) was a few months ago. I had been basically PMO-free for a year, but I would relapse for a couple weeks at a time every couple months or so. I lied to myself, saying it was not that big of a problem. Hint: it is.
I'm glad the guy got the money.  The people who need to be in incarcerated are up in the legislature making marijuana grows illegal.
I suppose we can just agree to disagree on what comics are about. Considering that one of your favorite heroes, Storm, came from the X-Men- which is a comic that **the creator himself has talked about being a soap box about gay rights**, I don't think we're going to see eye to eye on this one, and I guess that's okay. You've been plenty civil and I appreciate that. I really don't think that you can take race, gender and sexuality away from characters; it makes them who they are. It's not like they're only those elements, but those elements are a PART of them as well. Being 'colorblind' was considered a good thing back in the 90's, but it's not OK anymore. If you want I could find you some interviews and articles from minority perspectives on why being colorblind is actually not good for society. [Here is a great interview gifset from a content creator on his perspective](http://thankyouforyourcooperation.tumblr.com/post/107263474869/this-too-too-sullied-flesh-x-read-patrick)I think media is important, very, very important. I think it shapes how society functions and how we function as human beings. I think that it's easy for men to disregard how important representation because they've always had representation. They don't know what it's like to not see themselves in something. They don't know what it's like to have only a single token female character on a team, if they're lucky to get that at all. The only show I can think of that has more female characters than male characters is Steven Universe and MLP for cryin' out loud- and that leaves out the concept of race and sexuality entirely. Hank Pym could be the most interesting man on the planet, and I'm glad that you have that character to love and enjoy, and I'm sure it's great that he's getting a movie; but that doesn't mean anything when it comes to his representation. When we've got decades of films with white male actors playing all the superheroes from Marvel and DC, and not a single one of them has been a lead with a woman, or a person of color, don't you think that's pretty evident of a system that favors white men?? It kind of doesn't get more transparent than that. If your answer is 'Well Thor/Iron Man/Captain America/Wolverine/Spider Man/Batman/Superman are just more popular!' then my answer to you would be 'And freakin' Ant-Man is more popular than Wonder Woman? Captain Marvel? Elektra?' At least I've heard of their characters before! Anywho, it's time for Game of Thrones night, so I'm going to leave for the evening likely. Cheers.
Thanks, and no problem! I didn't see a post on reddit with the step by step process, so I thought I'd share. I'm glad you didn't feel any guilt with your choice either.
Anytime! I'm glad it works for you!
They are a good option and I'm glad they're there, but I hate that the buses go to all the value resorts, which makes the bus rides in general much worse after a long day at the parks. My family exclusively went to value resorts when I was a kid because that's pretty much all we could afford, but now my wife and I always go to at least moderate and find it is highly worth the upgrade in a lot of ways. I do have a very hard time justifying Deluxe resorts though, unless they have a prime location.
Awesome! Sounds like you guys had a good time, I'm glad to hear it. 
I don't think it should even be chat restriction worthy. You lost because you suck. I'm glad if at low elo's enemy's get called GG ez because they're not stuck because of the team, they're stuck because themselves 
I'm glad you see it that way, but cangiz doesn't seem to be that reasonable, as seen as another comment on my reply.
As a C9 fan since their promotion, I'm glad Incarnati0n is the one that replaced Hai. I want to say thanks to Hai again, for being part of this awesome team, but we got to move forward. A new era begins!
Thank you! I'm glad you liked it :D.
League games tend to run longer than SC games, and have more set up besides with picks and bans and the fact that SC games are literally just two people... League has a few more than that. Still going to say that it would be shitty to expect players to stay in these seats for two consecutive hours, and furthermore, denying them the freedom to consult with coaches between matches to develop a strategic response would be problematic as well as possibly decreasing the quality of the games.For those who just want to watch the action, vods are available, but I think LCS is about the whole experience and I'm glad they've adapted the approach they have, I also respect the reasons why.
I'm not frustrated, I'm happy with my position while i'm trying to climb to diamond. It's just sad to see how many people are just so angry that they don't even try to climb higher, they just keep playing bad and getting more and more angry.
Congrats to this guy! His application video was good. I'm glad he got a shot.
Good I'm glad you at least play him.  I think I have only managed 120 ranked games of shaco this season I didn't even start til last month one acct g2 the other p5. I stopped playing shaco in normals once I decided to only play him in ranked. Didn't feel right try harding that much in normals. What were you previous seasons ranks with him? My goal this year is to hit diamond playing only shaco all roles and its going pretty good as it always does lol.
Well I'm glad you're not drawing massive conclusions from one side of the story
Thanks, I was a little nervous about how people would take my controversial opinion. I'm glad people like you can appreciate it
I'm happy with this game, would have been amazing if they won but they clearly showed EU is stronger than everyone has been saying for the past weeks.
I'm glad,  it will have no impact on my life and it should reduce crime
I've been a pharmacy tech in the army for the last few years. Some of the civilian pharmacists we have came to work because the retail side is just so grueling. The work pace is much faster as well as the metrics you mentioned. Often times the pharmacy manager of places like Walmart aren't even a pharmacist which can cause unrealistic expectations of work staff. On the other hand in the Military you constantly have a changing leadership every 2-5 years so a lot of policies or consistencies can change. Another big thing my friend always talks about is the work hours. If you have a family or plan on starting a family you will be home around 5 or 6 depending on the command/base, will at least have Sunday off almost guaranteed, and have all federal holidays and often times at least one 3 day or 4 day weekend a month. Also don't forget the military has a version of a 401(k) called the Thrift Savings Plan which matches up to 3% I believe.Sorry for a big post but I'm glad to answer any other info  
Shane speaks to my soul, I'm glad he speaks to yours as well. =] Dude exudes cool in a way I can only dream of.
Well ya, when Ru said he'll be judging in pairs, I knew it was Trixie who was going home :/// I'm sad for her, but I'm happy that Katya got to stay.
Oh, I'm glad I'm not the only one. I love Katya. She's very endearing and fierce. But I honestly don't find her funny. Fun, yes, funny, no.
Thanks. I'm glad to hear you did things the way you wanted as well. Best wishes :)
&gt; I'm happy to answer questionsIf you're not doing anything wrong, you shouldn't have anything to hide.Amirite?
You are welcome! I'm glad you enjoyed!
R U B Ying discriminative towards crystals?AM E THYST of fury will pummel you into the rocks below.A GATE will lock behind you, and you'll never escape.The CELESTITE and unbreaking.SA PPHIRES of hell will consume you for your negligence.QU ARTZ such as yourself will rot for eternity.The APATITES of the demons will be quenched by your rotting flesh.GE ODE our lives to the crystals, and this is how you repay them?Edit: Why?

Aww, you will have made his night by saying that. Supposedly I'm the "pretty" one. I'm glad he has a fan! 
&gt;And it seems that many RPers cannot find happiness with women. But you did so keep her.I'm happy independent of her. I don't have to keep her; she has to keep me.
I sit in thought for a few more seconds before snapping back to the conversation at hand"Oh, well I'm glad for that then!"
"I'm glad" I say smiling, the hint of redness still in my cheeks."I got some weird looks though. Ever seen a one handed guy cook food this well?" I ask sounding a little smug
Well I'm glad that they saw the show wasn't the same without him, and re-hire, even if he is a pain. Otherwise, the show probably couldn't have lasted as long without him.
I'm happy with how it is, not saying that it wouldn't be improved with more incentive etc, just saying that I like hots as it is nao [:
Haha, I'm glad my troubles from three months ago were able to assist you! :D
Yep that's how it works. I've been playing with rank 1s even though I was rank 30+, because I hadn't played enough games yet. Now i'm rank 1 as well, and I'm glad i didn't have to play against beginners for hundreds of games before the MMR kicked in
Jesus this game from what I remember was rough. The offensive line prevented anything from happening, and it's obvious it made Teddy press more. I think Teddy had a pretty bad throw in the beginning of this game, tried to force one into the end zone or something and the safety jumped it. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong I don't have Rewind. Their D-Line just ate us alive all day.Even though some of these games are rough to re-live I'm glad you're doing this.
I'm happy they have added the L86A2 into BF4 but it would be awesome if it had a SUSAT with it like a special sight for it; like with the F2000 and its special sight (the 1.6x scope)  PLEASE DO THIS!!! us Brits would be so happy :)
You posted this thread without proof, before seeing the video. I merely provided context. I'm happy I've explained myself now, this'll be the last reply. Funny how it's ok for you to glitch behind that wall but not others. Yeah, I saw you.
Thanks friend, I'm glad you think so! 
Oh there's something so comforting about using a new clean up brush and getting those sweet crisp cuticle lines. I'm glad other people out there understand cos I know I get odd looks from friends and family if I mention it! Haha. 
I was terrified of pregnancy before I was pregnant. Looking back on it now, I love it. I never felt so beautiful. It is scary but it can also be a lot of fun. I got flak for quitting work and having a baby but I'm glad im doing what makes me happy. I hope other people follow their happy path too.
Alrighty then. I'm fine with you holding that opinion, as long as we acknowledge that has no impact on how things are handled in reality, which we did. I'm glad that people with such extreme views are not in power in the EU. 
 Okay, so he can only starve out 1/7th of our people with his money. Still too much. You're really not making a good point.All you're essentially saying is "We need some people to have everything while most have none".That makes you the more intelligent one, I know.I'm glad you can google and do math. As if I'm not just trying to bring up the sheer spending power that some have.
I'm glad you liked the write up!And who knows. It might have no downside, it might be super-carcinogenic (although I have a hard time seeing how - it's the exactly structure of glucose except mirrored so it can't be processed). I think it has laxative effects, so it may make people crap themselves if overused, which would be kinda hilarious in a messed up sort of way. "Oh look, there goes Bob. He shit himself eating too much cake again", lol.
I'm glad that we have unlimited data plans in The Netherlands. Gl with the 28GB left man.
"I'm glad..."
Sounds like you're a great animal owner - I've seen too many people who I'm glad don't have children if the way they look after animals is any indication............it's a big responsibility that a lot of people aren't prepared for
Yay a serious answer. I'm happy for you
Nice!  I'm glad all is well for you! =D  If I must ask, how old are you =p?
Thanks man! If you need any help on applications, I'm happy to do what I can. I applied to like 15 schools two years ago, haha
Haha I'm glad too or else he'd ride my ass. He's a lot more relaxed with me than with some of my coworkers
Dude that's nuts. Didn't know that. I'm glad he didn't take it. Kelsey Grammar is my soul.
I have mixed feelings about Suicide Squad, going of images alone it looks kinda dumb (media shit show about the Joker being evidence of that). Like you I'm glad to see Harley make her live action debut but I hope they do more with her then just "property of Joker" (it says that on her clothes). Then again there's been literally no footage of suicide squad so I suppose I should reserve judgment until I see at least a trailer. I didn't hate man of steel like most people did but I can see why people would. The fights scenes are big dumb dragonball fights, which I normally approve of, but the whole movie just wasn't fun. There was no joy, or any of that hopeful feeling that superman was supposedly embodying.Say what you will about Supergirl, at least there's colour. 
I'm glad I'm not the only one experiencing this, I got 8GB RAM installed and it's only using about 2.5GB of RAM. I'm still new to this whole PC thing, I was wondering if we could mess around with .ini document to make it higher?
I'm glad you were so insistent. I tracked the problem down to my default outfit having a mask but not showing it. So apparently you can't wear a mask and an earpiece :( Or at least some of the masks don't work.
Ooooh I like the idea of a sickly sweet/rotten scent for Sauron! That would be really fitting. And yes, a chart definitely helps keep track of everyone haha!I'm glad you liked the suggestions! I could talk about the Silmarillion all day :)
I'm glad she's all right.And I'm kind of glad I wasn't there freaking out about everything on top of my own problems. Especially being banned and all.
"I'm Chewie. He's Fuckface."*Who?*I'm glad they enjoyed Shit King. Still need a fourth, though.
Well I'm glad the car is smiling, we can clearly see this is consensual...
There is a huge amount of misinformation above this post. I'm glad someone finally showed up to correct them. 
Silver: Yeah, but I'm glad with what we got.
I'm talking about 3 (boyfriends at the time) in the span of 10 years. Are you asking for literal stories? I mean, I had my reasons. I mean, I'm happy they were aware of their and my size else I would have had a broken face, literally.
Must be really new to this. I'm glad you corrected him early, hopefully he retains it.
I'm glad you're asking these questions, but I'd advise you to talk to a (good) doctor, and not just trust strangers on reddit.As it so happens, I know the answer for this -- I'd stake my karma on it. Anorexia is diagnosed when a person has a BMI *under* 18.0, and has achieved that low weight through purposeful food restriction while having issues with the appearance of their body, the role of food &amp; nutrition in their lives or, most commonly with anorexia, body dysmorphic disorder.*IF* you restrict effectively and as a result have a BMI of &lt;18.0, you will be diagnosed with anorexia. You will also lose hair from your head, grow hair on your body and face, be cold all of the time, be tired all of the time, lose your interest in sex, develop a worldview in which lying to those you love is completely natural, and through regular restriction, you will annihilate any chance your psychology might have had at properly understanding food and nutrition.Even on pro-ana websites, no one who is unfortunate enough to be diagnosed with anorexia nervosa would sit back while someone else purposefully developed the behaviors which create the disorder. If you are asking, today, how you can become unhealthy, then technically, you are somewhat healthy now. Health is not worth any risk. Health is the ONLY thing you have, in a philosophical sense. There are so, so, so many ways to reduce your weight from any BMI to one around 18.0 or slightly above it, and you could, at this weight, be noticeably thin. The more stress you put on numbers, loss, and diminishing the space you take up, however, the less satisfied you will be with that low BMI, and you could possibly begin to genuinely believe that wasting away, losing so much weight that your organs literally fail and send you to an early grave, is completely reasonable.Restriction causes depression. Depression is terrible - it can be *living death*. Do what you can for yourself now, or you'll never, ever come back.
My mom did the same thing when my dad did have contact with us and was dating other women. She'd put them down and accused some of them of being women he'd cheated on her with, though he had never known them prior to the divorce. My dad did occasionally talk about my step-dad, I guess out of jealousy, but he later apologized for it, whereas my mother never did.I'm glad you were able to see through the lies, too. It's such a strain mentally after coming out of that, I said in another comment that it gave me difficulty trusting people about things they said. Good thing your happier now!
This is EXACTLY what I saw! I'm glad I'm not the only one.
I'm glad you NJOY'd yourself with B-X Vapor's flavors.  Even tho a lot of us have different VUSE on flavor subjectivity, we can all agree that B-X Vapor puts a HALO over their angelic flavors which really BLU me away, too.
I sincerely love this woman and I'm glad things are working out for her. 
Haha thank you.  I'm glad you like it.  You had a lot of fun hair to draw, I'm just sorry I didn't have the right color.
